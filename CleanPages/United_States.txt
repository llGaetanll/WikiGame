Disputes with ||Kingdom_of_Great_Britain|| over ||History_of_taxation_in_the_United_States|| and ||No_taxation_without_representation|| led to the ||American_Revolutionary_War|| (1775–1783), which established the nation's ||Independence||.

Contents Etymology See also: ||Naming_of_the_Americas||, ||Names_of_the_United_States||, ||Names_for_United_States_citizens||, and ||American_(word)|| The first known use of the name "||Americas||" dates back to 1507, when it appeared on a world map produced by the German cartographer ||Martin_Waldseem%C3%BCller|| in the ||France|| city of ||Saint-Di%C3%A9-des-Vosges||. On ||Waldseem%C3%BCller_map||, the name is shown in large letters on what would now be considered ||South_America||, in honor of ||Amerigo_Vespucci||. The Italian explorer was the first to postulate that the ||West_Indies|| did not represent Asia's eastern limit but were part of a previously unknown landmass. In 1538, the Flemish cartographer ||Gerardus_Mercator|| used the name "America" on his own world map, applying it to the entire ||Western_Hemisphere||. The first documentary evidence of the phrase "United States of America" dates from a January 2, 1776 letter written by ||Stephen_Moylan|| to ||George_Washington||'s ||Aide-de-camp|| ||Joseph_Reed_(politician)||. Moylan expressed his wish to go "with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain" to seek assistance in the ||American_Revolutionary_War|| effort. The first known publication of the phrase "United States of America" was in an anonymous essay in ||The_Virginia_Gazette|| newspaper in ||Williamsburg,_Virginia||, on April 6, 1776. The second draft of the ||Articles_of_Confederation||, prepared by ||John_Dickinson|| and completed no later than June 17, 1776, declared "The name of this Confederation shall be the 'United States of America'." The final version of the Articles, sent to the states for ratification in late 1777, stated that "The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America'." In June 1776, ||Thomas_Jefferson|| wrote the phrase "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA" in all capitalized letters in the headline of his "original Rough draught" of the ||United_States_Declaration_of_Independence||. This draft of the document did not surface until June 21, 1776, and it is unclear whether it was written before or after Dickinson used the term in his June 17 draft of the Articles of Confederation. The phrase "United States" was originally plural in American usage. It described a collection of states—e.g., "the United States are..." The singular form became popular after the end of the ||American_Civil_War|| and is now standard usage. A ||Citizenship_of_the_United_States|| is an "||Americans||". "United States", "American", and "U.S." refer to the country adjectivally ("American values", "U.S. forces"). In English, the word "||American_(word)||" rarely refers to topics or subjects not directly connected with the United States. History Main articles: ||History_of_the_United_States|| and ||Outline_of_United_States_history|| Indigenous peoples and pre-Columbian history Further information: ||Native_Americans_in_the_United_States||, ||Prehistory_of_the_United_States||, and ||Pre-Columbian_era||  The ||Cliff_Palace||, built by the ||Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas|| ||Ancestral_Puebloans|| between AD 1190 and 1260 It has been generally accepted that the ||Settlement_of_the_Americas|| migrated from ||Siberia|| by way of the ||Beringia|| and arrived at least 12,000 years ago; however, some evidence suggests an even earlier date of arrival. The ||Clovis_culture||, which appeared around 11,000 BC, is believed to represent the first wave of human settlement of the Americas. This was likely the first of three major waves of migration into North America; later waves brought the ancestors of present-day Athabaskans, Aleuts, and Eskimos. Over time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly complex, and some, such as the pre-Columbian ||Mississippian_culture|| in the southeast, developed advanced ||Agriculture||, ||Architecture||, and complex societies. The city-state of ||Cahokia|| is the largest, most complex pre-Columbian ||Archaeology|| in the modern-day United States. In the ||Four_Corners|| region, ||Ancestral_Puebloan|| culture developed from centuries of agricultural experimentation. The ||Iroquois||, located in the southern ||Great_Lakes|| region, was established at some point between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries. Most prominent along the Atlantic coast were the ||Algonquian_peoples|| tribes, who practiced hunting and trapping, along with limited ||Gardening||. Estimating the native population of North America at the time of European contact is difficult. ||Douglas_H._Ubelaker|| of the ||Smithsonian_Institution|| estimated that there was a population of 92,916 in the south Atlantic states and a population of 473,616 in the Gulf states, but most academics regard this figure as too low. ||Anthropologist|| ||Henry_F._Dobyns|| believed the populations were much higher, suggesting around 1.1 million along the shores of the ||Gulf_of_Mexico||, 2.2 million people living between ||Florida|| and ||Massachusetts||, 5.2 million in the ||Mississippi_Valley|| and tributaries, and around 700,000 people in the ||Florida_peninsula||. European settlements Further information: ||Colonial_history_of_the_United_States|| and ||Thirteen_Colonies|| Claims of very early colonization of coastal New England by the ||Norse_colonization_of_North_America|| are disputed and controversial. The first documented arrival of Europeans in the continental United States is that of Spanish ||Conquistador|| such as ||Juan_Ponce_de_Le%C3%B3n||, who made his first expedition to ||Spanish_Florida|| in 1513. Even earlier, ||Christopher_Columbus|| had landed in ||Puerto_Rico|| on his ||Columbus%27s_second_voyage||, and ||San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico|| was settled by the Spanish a decade later. The Spanish set up the first settlements in Florida and New Mexico, such as ||St._Augustine,_Florida||, often considered the nation's oldest city, and ||Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico||. The French ||New_France|| their own settlements along the ||Mississippi_River||, notably ||New_Orleans||. Successful ||British_colonization_of_the_Americas|| of the eastern coast of North America began with the ||Colony_of_Virginia|| in 1607 at ||Jamestown,_Virginia|| and with the ||Pilgrims_(Plymouth_Colony)||' ||Plymouth_Colony|| in 1620. The continent's first elected legislative assembly, Virginia's ||House_of_Burgesses||, was founded in 1619. Documents such as the ||Mayflower_Compact|| and the ||Fundamental_Orders_of_Connecticut|| established precedents for representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies. Many English settlers were ||English_Dissenters|| who came seeking ||Freedom_of_religion||. In 1784, the Russians were the first Europeans to establish a ||Russian_colonization_of_the_Americas||, at ||Three_Saints_Bay||. ||Russian_America|| once spanned much of the present-day state of ||Alaska||. In the early days of colonization, many European settlers were subject to food shortages, disease, and attacks from ||Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas||. Native Americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and European settlers. In many cases, however, the natives and settlers came to depend on one another. Settlers ||Columbian_exchange|| for food and animal pelts; natives for guns, tools and other European goods. Natives taught many settlers to cultivate corn, beans, and other foodstuffs. European missionaries and others felt it was important to "civilize" the Native Americans and urged them to adopt European agricultural practices and lifestyles. However, with the increased European ||Settler_colonialism|| of North America, the ||Native_Americans_in_the_United_States|| were ||American_Indian_Wars||. The ||Population_history_of_indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas|| after European arrival for various reasons, primarily diseases such as ||Smallpox|| and ||Measles||.  The original ||Thirteen_Colonies|| (shown in red) in 1775 European settlers also began ||Human_trafficking|| of ||Slavery_in_the_colonial_United_States|| into Colonial America via the ||Atlantic_slave_trade||. Because of a lower prevalence of tropical diseases and better ||Treatment_of_the_enslaved_in_the_United_States||, slaves had a much higher life expectancy in North America than in South America, leading to a rapid increase in their numbers. Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery, and several colonies passed acts both against and in favor of the practice. However, by the turn of the 18th century, African slaves had supplanted European ||Indentured_servitude|| as ||Cash_crop|| labor, especially in the American South. The ||Thirteen_Colonies|| (||Province_of_New_Hampshire||, ||Province_of_Massachusetts_Bay||, ||Connecticut_Colony||, ||Colony_of_Rhode_Island_and_Providence_Plantations||, ||Province_of_New_York||, ||Province_of_New_Jersey||, ||Province_of_Pennsylvania||, ||Delaware_Colony||, ||Province_of_Maryland||, ||Colony_of_Virginia||, ||Province_of_North_Carolina||, ||Province_of_South_Carolina||, and ||Province_of_Georgia||) that would become the United States of America were administered by the British as overseas dependencies. All nonetheless had local governments with elections open to most free men. With extremely high birth rates, low death rates, and steady settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly, eclipsing Native American populations. The ||Christian_revival|| movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the ||First_Great_Awakening|| fueled interest both in religion and in religious liberty. During the ||Seven_Years%27_War|| (1756–1763), known in the U.S. as the ||French_and_Indian_War||, British forces captured Canada from the French. With the creation of the ||Province_of_Quebec_(1763%E2%80%931791)||, Canada's ||French_language|| population would remain isolated from the English-speaking colonial dependencies of ||Nova_Scotia||, ||Newfoundland_Colony|| and the Thirteen Colonies. Excluding the ||Native_Americans_in_the_United_States|| who lived there, the Thirteen Colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about a third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the rate of natural increase was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas. The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their unprecedented success motivated British monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority. Independence and expansion Further information: ||American_Revolution|| and ||Territorial_evolution_of_the_United_States||  ||Declaration_of_Independence_(Trumbull)||, a painting by ||John_Trumbull||, depicts the ||Committee_of_Five|| presenting the draft of the ||United_States_Declaration_of_Independence|| to the ||Second_Continental_Congress||, July 4, 1776. The ||American_Revolutionary_War|| fought by the ||Thirteen_Colonies|| against the ||British_Empire|| was the first successful ||War_of_independence|| by a non-European entity against a European power in ||Modern_history||. Americans had developed an ideology of "||Republicanism_in_the_United_States||", asserting that government rested on the will of the people as expressed in their local legislatures. They demanded their "||Rights_of_Englishmen||" and "||No_taxation_without_representation||". The British insisted on administering the empire through Parliament, and the conflict escalated into war. The ||Second_Continental_Congress||, an assembly representing the ||United_Colonies||, unanimously adopted the ||United_States_Declaration_of_Independence|| on July 4, 1776; this day is celebrated annually as ||Independence_Day_(United_States)||. In 1777, the ||Articles_of_Confederation|| established a decentralized government that operated until 1789. After its defeat at the ||Siege_of_Yorktown_(1781)|| in 1781, Britain signed a ||Treaty_of_Paris_(1783)||. American sovereignty became internationally recognized, and the country was granted all lands east of the ||Mississippi_River||. Tensions with Britain remained, however, leading to the ||War_of_1812||, which was fought to a draw. Nationalists led the ||Constitutional_Convention_(United_States)|| of 1787 in writing the ||United_States_Constitution||, ||Ratification_of_the_United_States_Constitution|| in state conventions in 1788. ||Coming_into_force|| in 1789, this constitution reorganized the federal government into three branches, on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances. ||George_Washington||, who had led the ||Continental_Army|| to victory, was the first ||President_of_the_United_States|| elected under the new constitution. The ||United_States_Bill_of_Rights||, forbidding federal restriction of ||Natural_and_legal_rights|| and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791.  ||Territorial_evolution_of_the_United_States|| between 1783 and 1917 Although the federal government ||Act_Prohibiting_Importation_of_Slaves|| American participation in the Atlantic slave trade in 1807, after 1820, cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the ||Deep_South||, and along with it, the slave population. The ||Second_Great_Awakening||, especially in the period 1800–1840, converted millions to ||Evangelicalism_in_the_United_States|| Protestantism. In the North, it energized multiple social reform movements, including ||Abolitionism_in_the_United_States||; in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized among slave populations. Beginning in the late 18th century, American settlers began to ||Territorial_evolution_of_the_United_States||, prompting a long series of ||American_Indian_Wars||. The 1803 ||Louisiana_Purchase|| almost doubled the nation's area, ||Adams%E2%80%93On%C3%ADs_Treaty|| and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819, the ||Republic_of_Texas|| was ||Texas_annexation|| in 1845 during a period of expansionism, and the 1846 ||Oregon_Treaty|| with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day ||Northwestern_United_States||. Victory in the ||Mexican%E2%80%93American_War|| resulted in the 1848 ||Mexican_Cession|| of ||California|| and much of the present-day ||Southwestern_United_States||, making the U.S. span the continent. The ||California_Gold_Rush|| of 1848–1849 spurred migration to the Pacific coast, which led to the ||California_Genocide|| and the creation of additional western states. The giving away of vast quantities of land to white European settlers as part of the ||Homestead_Acts||, nearly 10% of the total area of the United States, and to private railroad companies and colleges as part of ||Land_grants|| spurred ||Economic_development||. After the Civil War, new transcontinental ||Rail_transportation_in_the_United_States#History|| made relocation easier for settlers, expanded internal trade, and increased conflicts with Native Americans. In 1869, a new ||Presidency_of_Ulysses_S._Grant#Native_American_affairs|| nominally promised to protect Native Americans from abuses, avoid further war, and secure their eventual U.S. citizenship. Nonetheless, large-scale conflicts continued throughout the West into the 1900s. Civil War and Reconstruction era Main articles: ||American_Civil_War|| and ||Reconstruction_era||  The ||Battle_of_Gettysburg||, fought between ||Union_Army|| and ||Confederate_States_Army|| forces on July 1–3, 1863, around the town of ||Gettysburg,_Pennsylvania||, marked a turning point in the ||American_Civil_War||. Irreconcilable sectional conflict regarding ||Slavery_in_the_United_States|| of ||African_people|| and ||African_Americans|| ultimately led to the ||Origins_of_the_American_Civil_War||. With the ||1860_United_States_presidential_election|| of ||Republican_Party_(United_States)|| ||Abraham_Lincoln||, conventions in thirteen slave states declared secession and formed the ||Confederate_States_of_America|| (the "South" or the "Confederacy"), while the federal government (the "||Union_(American_Civil_War)||") maintained that secession was illegal. In order to bring about this secession, military action was initiated by the secessionists, and the Union responded in kind. The ensuing war would become the deadliest military conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of approximately 620,000 soldiers as well as upwards of 50,000 civilians. The Union initially simply fought to keep the country united. Nevertheless, as casualties mounted after 1863 and Lincoln delivered his ||Emancipation_Proclamation||, the main purpose of the war from the Union's viewpoint became the abolition of slavery. Indeed, when the Union ultimately won the war in April 1865, each of the states in the defeated South was required to ratify the ||Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution||, which prohibited slavery except as ||Penal_labor_in_the_United_States||. Two other amendments were also ratified, ensuring citizenship and voting rights for blacks. ||Reconstruction_(United_States)|| began in earnest following the war. While President Lincoln attempted to foster friendship and forgiveness between the Union and the former Confederacy, ||Assassination_of_Abraham_Lincoln|| on April 14, 1865 drove a wedge between North and South again. Republicans in the federal government made it their goal to oversee the rebuilding of the South and to ensure the rights of African Americans. They persisted until the ||Compromise_of_1877|| when the Republicans agreed to cease protecting the rights of African Americans in the South in order for Democrats to concede the ||1876_United_States_presidential_election||. Southern white Democrats, calling themselves "||Redeemers||", took control of the South after the end of Reconstruction, beginning the ||Nadir_of_American_race_relations||. From 1890 to 1910, the Redeemers established so-called ||Jim_Crow_laws||, ||Disenfranchisement_after_the_Reconstruction_Era|| most blacks and some impoverished whites throughout the region. Blacks would face ||Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States|| nationwide, especially in the South. They also occasionally experienced vigilante violence, including ||Lynching_in_the_United_States||. Further immigration, expansion, and industrialization Main articles: ||Economic_history_of_the_United_States||, ||Immigration_to_the_United_States||, and ||Technological_and_industrial_history_of_the_United_States||  Film by ||Edison_Studios|| showing immigrants disembarking at ||Ellis_Island|| in ||New_York_Harbor||, which served as a major entry point for European ||Immigration_to_the_United_States|| into the U.S. In the North, urbanization and an unprecedented ||History_of_immigration_to_the_United_States|| from ||Southern_Europe|| and ||Eastern_Europe|| supplied a surplus of labor for the country's industrialization and transformed its culture. National infrastructure, including ||First_Transcontinental_Telegraph|| and ||First_Transcontinental_Railroad||, spurred economic growth and greater settlement and development of the ||American_frontier||. The later invention of ||Incandescent_light_bulb|| and the ||Telephone|| would also affect communication and urban life. The United States fought ||American_Indian_Wars|| west of the Mississippi River from 1810 to at least 1890. Most of these conflicts ended with the cession of Native American territory and their confinement to ||Indian_reservation||. Additionally, the ||Trail_of_Tears|| in the 1830s exemplified the ||Indian_Removal_Act|| that forcibly resettled Indians. This further expanded acreage under mechanical cultivation, increasing surpluses for international markets. Mainland expansion also included the ||Alaska_Purchase|| from ||Russian_Empire|| in 1867. In 1893, pro-American elements in Hawaii ||Overthrow_of_the_Kingdom_of_Hawaii|| the ||Kingdom_of_Hawaii|| and formed the ||Republic_of_Hawaii||, which the U.S. ||Newlands_Resolution|| in 1898. ||Puerto_Rico||, ||Guam||, and the ||Philippines|| were ceded by Spain in the same year, following the ||Spanish%E2%80%93American_War||. ||American_Samoa|| was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the end of the ||Second_Samoan_Civil_War||. The ||United_States_Virgin_Islands|| were purchased from Denmark in 1917. ||Gilded_Age|| during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists. ||Business_magnate|| like ||Cornelius_Vanderbilt||, ||John_D._Rockefeller||, and ||Andrew_Carnegie|| led the nation's progress in the ||Railways||, ||Petroleum_industry||, and ||History_of_the_steel_industry_(1850%E2%80%931970)|| industries. Banking became a major part of the economy, with ||J._P._Morgan|| playing a notable role. The American economy boomed, becoming the world's largest. These dramatic changes were accompanied by growing inequality and social unrest, which prompted the rise of ||Labor_history_of_the_United_States|| along with ||People%27s_Party_(United_States)||, ||History_of_the_socialist_movement_in_the_United_States||, and ||Anarchism_in_the_United_States|| movements. This period eventually ended with the advent of the ||Progressive_Era||, which saw significant reforms including ||Women%27s_suffrage||, ||Prohibition_in_the_United_States||, regulation of consumer goods, and greater ||United_States_antitrust_law|| to ensure competition and attention to worker conditions. World War I, Great Depression, and World War II Further information: ||World_War_I||, ||Great_Depression||, and ||World_War_II||  The ||Empire_State_Building|| was the tallest building in the world when completed in 1931, during the ||Great_Depression||. The United States remained neutral from the outbreak of ||World_War_I|| in 1914 until 1917 when it joined the war as an "associated power" alongside the ||Allies_of_World_War_I||, helping to turn the tide against the ||Central_Powers||. In 1919, President ||Woodrow_Wilson|| took a leading diplomatic role at the ||Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919|| and advocated strongly for the U.S. to join the ||League_of_Nations||. However, the Senate refused to approve this and did not ratify the ||Treaty_of_Versailles|| that established the League of Nations. In 1920, the women's rights movement won passage of a ||Nineteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution|| granting ||Women%27s_suffrage_in_the_United_States||. The 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of ||Radio|| for ||Mass_communication|| and the invention of early ||Television||. The prosperity of the ||Roaring_Twenties|| ended with the ||Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929|| and the onset of the ||Great_Depression_in_the_United_States||. After his election as president in 1932, ||Franklin_D._Roosevelt|| responded with the ||New_Deal||. The ||Great_Migration_(African_American)|| of millions of African Americans out of the American South began before World War I and extended through the 1960s; whereas the ||Dust_Bowl|| of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration.  U.S. Marines ||Raising_the_Flag_on_Iwo_Jima|| on ||Mount_Suribachi|| during the ||Battle_of_Iwo_Jima|| in one of the most iconic images of the war At first effectively neutral during ||Military_history_of_the_United_States_during_World_War_II||, the United States began supplying materiel to the ||Allies_of_World_War_II|| in March 1941 through the ||Lend-Lease|| program. On December 7, 1941, the ||Empire_of_Japan|| launched a surprise ||Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor||, prompting the United States to join the Allies against the ||Axis_powers||, and in the following year, to ||Internment_of_Japanese_Americans|| about 120,000 U.S. residents (including American citizens) of Japanese descent. Although Japan attacked the United States first, the U.S. nonetheless pursued a "||Europe_first||" defense policy. The United States thus left its vast Asian colony, the ||Philippines||, isolated and fighting a losing struggle against ||Japanese_occupation_of_the_Philippines||. During the war, the United States was one of the "||Four_Policemen||" who met to plan the postwar world, along with Britain, the Soviet Union, and China. Although the nation lost around 400,000 military personnel, it emerged ||World_War_II_casualties#Human_losses_by_country|| from the war with even greater economic and military influence. The United States played a leading role in the ||Bretton_Woods_Conference|| and ||Yalta_Conference|| conferences, which signed agreements on new international financial institutions and Europe's postwar reorganization. As an ||Victory_in_Europe_Day||, a 1945 ||United_Nations_Conference_on_International_Organization|| held in ||San_Francisco|| produced the ||United_Nations_Charter||, which became active after the war. The United States and Japan then fought each other in the largest naval battle in history, the ||Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf||. The United States developed the ||Manhattan_Project|| and used them on Japan ||Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki|| in August 1945; the Japanese ||Surrender_of_Japan|| on September 2, ending World War II.

After World War II, the United States and the ||Soviet_Union|| competed for power, influence, and prestige during what became known as the ||Cold_War||, driven by an ideological divide between ||Capitalism|| and ||Communism||. They dominated the military affairs of Europe, with the U.S. and its ||NATO|| allies on one side and the Soviet Union and its ||Warsaw_Pact|| allies on the other. The U.S. developed a policy of ||Containment|| towards the expansion of communist influence. While the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in ||Proxy_war|| and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict. The United States often opposed ||Third_World|| movements that it viewed as Soviet-sponsored and occasionally pursued direct action for ||United_States_involvement_in_regime_change|| against left-wing governments, occasionally supporting authoritarian right-wing regimes. American troops fought communist ||People%27s_Liberation_Army|| and ||North_Korea|| forces in the ||Korean_War|| of 1950–1953. The Soviet Union's 1957 launch of the ||Sputnik_1|| and its 1961 launch of the ||Vostok_1|| initiated a "||Space_Race||" in which the United States became the first nation to ||Apollo_11|| in 1969. The United States became increasingly involved in the ||Vietnam_War|| (1955–1975), introducing combat forces in 1965. At home, the U.S. had experienced ||Post%E2%80%93World_War_II_economic_expansion|| and a ||Post%E2%80%93World_War_II_baby_boom|| and ||American_middle_class|| following World War II. After a surge in female labor participation, especially in the 1970s, by 1985, the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed. Construction of an ||Interstate_Highway_System|| transformed the nation's infrastructure over the following decades. Millions moved from farms and ||Inner_city|| to large ||Suburb|| housing developments. In 1959, the United States formally expanded beyond the ||Contiguous_United_States|| when the territories of ||Alaska|| and ||Hawaii|| became, respectively, the 49th and 50th states admitted into the Union. The growing ||Civil_Rights_Movement|| used ||Nonviolence|| to confront segregation and discrimination, with ||Martin_Luther_King_Jr.|| becoming a prominent leader and figurehead. A combination of court decisions and legislation, culminating in the ||Civil_Rights_Act_of_1968||, sought to end racial discrimination. Meanwhile, a ||Counterculture_of_the_1960s|| grew, which was fueled by ||Opposition_to_United_States_involvement_in_the_Vietnam_War||, the ||Black_Power_movement||, and the ||Sexual_revolution||. The launch of a "||War_on_Poverty||" expanded entitlements and welfare spending, including the creation of ||Medicare_(United_States)|| and ||Medicaid||, two programs that provide health coverage to the elderly and poor, respectively, and the ||Means-tested|| ||Food_Stamp_Program|| and ||Aid_to_Families_with_Dependent_Children||.  U.S. president ||Ronald_Reagan|| (left) and Soviet general secretary ||Mikhail_Gorbachev|| at the ||Geneva_Summit_(1985)|| in 1985 The 1970s and early 1980s saw the onset of ||Stagflation||. The United States supported Israel during the ||Yom_Kippur_War||; in response, the country faced an oil embargo from ||OPEC|| nations, sparking the ||1973_oil_crisis||. After his election, President ||Ronald_Reagan|| responded to economic stagnation with ||Reaganomics||. Following the collapse of ||D%C3%A9tente||, he abandoned "containment" and initiated the more aggressive "||Rollback||" strategy towards the Soviet Union. The late 1980s brought a "||Cold_War_(1985%E2%80%9391)||" in relations with the Soviet Union, and ||Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union|| in 1991 finally ended the Cold War. This brought about ||Unipolarity|| with the U.S. unchallenged as the world's dominant superpower. After the ||Cold_War||, the conflict in the Middle East triggered a crisis in 1990, when ||Ba%27athist_Iraq|| ||Invasion_of_Kuwait||, an ally of the United States. Fearing the spread of instability, in August, President ||George_H._W._Bush|| launched and led the ||Gulf_War|| against Iraq; waged until February 1991 by ||Coalition_of_the_Gulf_War|| from 34 nations, it ended in the expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait and restoration of the monarchy. Originating within ||ARPANET||, the ||Internet|| spread to international academic platforms and then to the public in the 1990s, greatly affecting the global economy, society, and culture. Due to the ||Dot-com_bubble||, stable monetary policy, and ||Personal_Responsibility_and_Work_Opportunity_Act||, the 1990s saw the ||1990s_United_States_boom|| in modern U.S. history. Beginning in 1994, the U.S. signed the ||North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement|| (NAFTA), causing trade among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico to soar. 21st century Main article: ||History_of_the_United_States_(2008%E2%80%93present)|| Further information: ||September_11_attacks||, ||War_on_terror||, ||Great_Recession_in_the_United_States||, and ||COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States||  The ||World_Trade_Center_(1973%E2%80%932001)|| in ||Lower_Manhattan|| during the ||September_11_attacks|| ||Terrorism|| by the ||Islamic_terrorism|| group ||Al-Qaeda|| in 2001 On ||September_11_attacks||, ||Al-Qaeda|| terrorist hijackers flew passenger planes into the ||World_Trade_Center_(1973%E2%80%932001)|| in New York City and ||The_Pentagon|| near Washington, D.C., killing nearly 3,000 people. Hundreds more died later from illnesses related to the attacks, and perhaps thousands of ||First_responders||, cleanup workers, and survivors suffer from long-term effects. In response, President ||George_W._Bush|| launched the ||War_on_Terror||, which included a nearly 20-year ||War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%93present)|| from 2001 to 2021 and the 2003–2011 ||Iraq_War||. A 2011 military operation in Pakistan led to the ||Killing_of_Osama_bin_Laden||. Government policy designed to promote affordable housing, widespread failures in corporate and regulatory governance, and historically low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve led to the ||United_States_housing_bubble|| in 2006, which culminated with the ||Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008|| and the ||Great_Recession||, the nation's largest economic contraction since the Great Depression.

Geography Main article: ||Geography_of_the_United_States||  ||K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification|| of U.S. states and territories The ||Contiguous_United_States|| and the District of Columbia occupy a combined area of 3,119,885 square miles (8,080,470 km). Of this area, 2,959,064 square miles (7,663,940 km) is contiguous land, composing 83.65% of total U.S. land area. ||Hawaii||, occupying an archipelago in the central ||Pacific_Ocean||, southwest of North America, is 10,931 square miles (28,311 km) in area. The five populated but unincorporated territories of ||Puerto_Rico||, ||American_Samoa||, ||Guam||, ||Northern_Mariana_Islands||, and ||United_States_Virgin_Islands|| together cover 9,185 square miles (23,789 km). Measured by only land area, the United States is third in size behind Russia and China, just ahead of Canada. The United States is the world's ||List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area|| (land and water), ranking behind Russia and Canada and nearly equal to China. The ranking varies depending on how two territories disputed by China and India are counted, and how the total size of the United States is measured. The ||Atlantic_coastal_plain|| of the ||Atlantic_Ocean|| seaboard gives way further inland to ||Deciduous|| forests and the rolling hills of the ||Piedmont_(United_States)||. The ||Appalachian_Mountains|| divide the eastern seaboard from the ||Great_Lakes|| and the grasslands of the ||Midwestern_United_States||. The ||Mississippi_River||–||Missouri_River||, the world's ||List_of_rivers_by_length||, runs mainly north–south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile ||Prairie|| of the ||Great_Plains|| stretches to the west, interrupted by ||U.S._Interior_Highlands|| in the southeast.  Rock formations in the ||Grand_Canyon||, northern ||Arizona|| The ||Rocky_Mountains||, west of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, peaking around 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in ||Colorado||. Farther west are the rocky ||Great_Basin|| and deserts such as the ||Chihuahuan_Desert|| and ||Mojave_Desert||. The ||Sierra_Nevada_(U.S.)|| and ||Cascade_Range|| mountain ranges run close to the ||West_Coast_of_the_United_States||, both ranges reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m). The ||Extreme_points_of_the_United_States|| in the ||Contiguous_United_States|| United States are in the state of ||California||, and only about 84 miles (135 km) apart.

The United States, with its large size and geographic variety, includes most climate types. To the east of the ||100th_meridian_west||, the climate ranges from ||Humid_continental_climate|| in the north to ||Humid_subtropical_climate|| in the south. The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are ||Semi-arid_climate||. Much of the Western mountains have an ||Alpine_climate||. The climate is ||Desert_climate|| in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, ||Mediterranean_climate|| in ||Coastal_California||, and ||Oceanic_climate|| in coastal ||Oregon|| and ||Washington_(state)|| and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is ||Subarctic_climate|| or ||Polar_climate||. Hawaii and the southern tip of ||Florida|| are ||Tropical_climate||, as well as its territories in the ||Caribbean|| and the Pacific. States bordering the ||Gulf_of_Mexico|| are prone to ||Tropical_cyclone||, and most of the world's ||Tornado|| occur in the country, mainly in ||Tornado_Alley|| areas in the Midwest and South. Overall, the United States receives more high-impact extreme weather incidents than any other country in the world. Biodiversity Main articles: ||Fauna_of_the_United_States|| and ||Flora_of_the_United_States||  The ||Bald_eagle|| has been the ||National_bird_of_the_United_States|| of the United States since 1782. The U.S. is one of 17 ||Megadiverse_countries|| containing large numbers of ||List_of_endangered_species_in_North_America||: about 17,000 species of ||Vascular_plant|| occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and more than 1,800 species of ||Flowering_plant|| are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland. The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 bird species, 311 reptile species, and 295 amphibian species, as well as about 91,000 insect species. There are 63 ||List_of_areas_in_the_United_States_National_Park_System|| and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and ||Wilderness|| areas, which are managed by the ||National_Park_Service||. Altogether, the government owns about 28% of the country's land area, mostly in the ||Western_United_States||. Most of this land is ||Protected_area||, though some is leased for oil and gas drilling, mining, logging, or cattle ranching, and about .86% is used for military purposes. ||Environmental_issues_in_the_United_States|| include debates on oil and ||Nuclear_binding_energy||, dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting ||Wildlife||, logging and ||Deforestation||, and ||Climate_change_in_the_United_States||. The most prominent environmental agency is the ||United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency|| (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970. The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the ||Wilderness_Act||. The ||Endangered_Species_Act|| of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the ||United_States_Fish_and_Wildlife_Service||. The United States is ranked 24th among nations in the ||Environmental_Performance_Index||.

In the ||Federalism#United_States||, citizens are usually subject to ||Political_divisions_of_the_United_States||: federal, state, and local. The ||Local_government_in_the_United_States||'s duties are commonly split between ||County_(United_States)|| and ||Municipal_corporation||. In almost all cases, executive and legislative officials are elected by a ||Plurality_voting_system|| of citizens by district. The government is regulated by a system of ||Separation_of_powers|| defined by the U.S. Constitution, which serves as the country's supreme legal document. The Constitution establishes the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states. ||Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution|| protects the right to the writ of ||Habeas_corpus_in_the_United_States||. The Constitution has been amended 27 times; the first ten amendments, which make up the ||United_States_Bill_of_Rights||, and the ||Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution|| form the central basis of Americans' individual rights. All laws and governmental procedures are subject to ||Judicial_review||, and any law can be voided if the courts determine that it violates the Constitution. The principle of judicial review, not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, was established by the Supreme Court in ||Marbury_v._Madison|| (1803) in a decision handed down by ||John_Marshall||. The federal government comprises three branches: ||Legislature||: The ||Bicameralism|| ||United_States_Congress||, made up of the ||United_States_Senate|| and the ||United_States_House_of_Representatives||, makes ||Federal_law||, ||Declaration_of_war||, approves treaties, has the ||Power_of_the_purse||, and has the power of ||Impeachment||, by which it can remove sitting members of the federal government. ||Executive_(government)||: ||President_of_the_United_States|| is the ||Commander-in-chief|| of the military, can veto ||Bill_(law)|| before they become law (subject to congressional override), and appoints the ||Cabinet_of_the_United_States|| (subject to Senate approval) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies. ||Judiciary||: The ||Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States|| and lower ||Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States||, whose judges are appointed by the president with Senate approval, interpret laws and overturn those they find ||Constitutionality||. The House of Representatives has 435 voting members, each representing a ||Congressional_district|| for a two-year term. House seats are ||United_States_congressional_apportionment|| among the states by population. Each state then draws single-member districts to conform with the census apportionment. The ||District_of_Columbia|| and the five major ||Territories_of_the_United_States|| each have ||Non-voting_members_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives||—these members are not allowed to vote. The Senate has 100 members with each state having two senators, elected ||At-large|| to six-year terms; one-third of Senate seats are up for election every two years. The District of Columbia and the five major U.S. territories do not have senators. The president serves a four-year term and may be elected to the office ||Term_limits_in_the_United_States||. The president is ||United_States_presidential_election||, but by an indirect ||Electoral_College_(United_States)|| system in which the determining votes are apportioned to the states and the District of Columbia. The Supreme Court, led by the ||Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States||, has nine members, who serve for life. Political divisions Main articles: ||Political_divisions_of_the_United_States||, ||U.S._state||, ||Territories_of_the_United_States||, ||List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States||, and ||Indian_reservation|| Further information: ||Territorial_evolution_of_the_United_States||  Map of the United States showing the ||U.S._state||, the ||District_of_Columbia||, and the five major ||Territories_of_the_United_States|| The ||U.S._state|| are the principal political divisions in the country. Each state holds jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, where it shares sovereignty with the federal government. They are subdivided into ||County_(United_States)|| or county equivalents and further divided into municipalities. The District of Columbia is a federal district that contains the capital of the United States, the city of Washington. The states and the District of Columbia choose the president of the United States. Each state has presidential electors equal to the number of their representatives and senators in Congress; the District of Columbia has three because of the ||Twenty-third_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution||. ||Territories_of_the_United_States|| of the United States such as Puerto Rico do not have presidential electors, and so people in those territories cannot vote for the president. The United States also observes ||Tribal_sovereignty_in_the_United_States|| of the American Indian nations to a limited degree, as it does with the states' sovereignty. American Indians are U.S. citizens and tribal lands are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress and the federal courts. Like the states they have a great deal of autonomy, but also like the states, tribes are not allowed to make war, engage in their own foreign relations, or print and issue currency. Reservations are usually part of a single state, though 12 reservations cross state boundaries. ||Indian_country_jurisdiction|| over civil and criminal matters is shared by tribes, states, and the federal government.

Parties and elections Main articles: ||Political_parties_in_the_United_States||, ||Elections_in_the_United_States||, and ||Political_ideologies_in_the_United_States|| ||Joe_Biden||46th ||President_of_the_United_States||||Kamala_Harris||49th ||Vice_President_of_the_United_States||since January 20, 2021 The United States has operated under a ||Two-party_system|| for most of its history. For elective offices at most levels, state-administered ||Primary_election|| choose the major party ||Nomination|| for subsequent ||General_election||. Since the ||1856_United_States_presidential_election||, the major parties have been the ||Democratic_Party_(United_States)||, ||History_of_the_United_States_Democratic_Party||, and the ||Republican_Party_(United_States)||, ||History_of_the_United_States_Republican_Party||. Since the Civil War, only one ||Third_party_(United_States)|| presidential candidate—former president ||Theodore_Roosevelt||, running as a ||Progressive_Party_(United_States,_1912)|| in ||1912_United_States_presidential_election||—has won as much as 20% of the popular vote, though the self-financed ||Reform_Party_of_the_United_States_of_America|| campaign of ||Ross_Perot|| took 18.9% in 1992. The president and vice president are elected by the ||Electoral_College_(United_States)||. In American ||Political_culture||, the ||Center-right_politics|| Republican Party is considered "||Conservatism_in_the_United_States||" and the ||Centre-left_politics|| Democratic Party is considered "||Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States||". The states of the ||Politics_of_the_Northeastern_United_States|| and ||Politics_of_the_Western_United_States|| and some of the Great Lakes states, known as "||Red_states_and_blue_states||", are relatively liberal. The "||Political_party_strength_in_U.S._states||" of the ||Politics_of_the_Southern_United_States|| and parts of the ||Midwestern_United_States#Politics|| and ||Politics_of_the_Western_United_States|| are relatively conservative. ||Democratic_Party_(United_States)|| ||Joe_Biden||, the winner of the ||2020_United_States_presidential_election|| and former vice president, is serving as the 46th ||President_of_the_United_States||. Leadership in the Senate includes Vice President ||Kamala_Harris||, President pro tempore ||Patrick_Leahy||, ||Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_Senate|| ||Chuck_Schumer||, and Minority Leader ||Mitch_McConnell||. Leadership in the House includes Speaker of the House ||Nancy_Pelosi||, ||Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives|| ||Steny_Hoyer||, and Minority Leader ||Kevin_McCarthy_(California_politician)||. In the ||117th_United_States_Congress||, the ||United_States_House_of_Representatives|| and the ||United_States_Senate|| are narrowly controlled by the Democratic Party. The Senate consists of 50 Republicans and 48 Democrats with two ||Independent_politician|| who caucus with the Democrats, with Vice President Harris, a Democrat, able to break ties. The House consists of 221 Democrats and 209 Republicans. Of ||List_of_United_States_governors||, there are 28 Republicans and 22 Democrats. Among the D.C. mayor and the five territorial governors, there are three Democrats, one Republican, and one ||New_Progressive_Party_of_Puerto_Rico||. Foreign relations Main articles: ||Foreign_relations_of_the_United_States|| and ||Foreign_policy_of_the_United_States||  The ||Headquarters_of_the_United_Nations|| has been situated in ||Midtown_Manhattan|| since 1952. The United States is a founding member of the United Nations. The United States has an established structure of foreign relations. It is a ||Permanent_members_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council|| of the ||United_Nations_Security_Council||, and New York City is home to the ||Headquarters_of_the_United_Nations||. It is also a member of the ||G7||, ||G-20_major_economies||, and ||OECD||. Almost all countries have ||List_of_diplomatic_missions_in_the_United_States|| in Washington, D.C., and many have ||Consul_(representative)|| around the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host American diplomatic missions. However, ||Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations||, ||North_Korea%E2%80%93United_States_relations||, ||Foreign_relations_of_Bhutan#Other_countries||, and ||Taiwan%E2%80%93United_States_relations|| do not have formal diplomatic relations with the United States (although the U.S. maintains unofficial relations with Taiwan and supplies it with ||Six_Assurances||). The United States has a "||Special_Relationship||" with the ||United_Kingdom%E2%80%93United_States_relations|| and strong ties with ||Canada%E2%80%93United_States_relations||, ||Australia%E2%80%93United_States_relations||, ||New_Zealand%E2%80%93United_States_relations||, ||Philippines%E2%80%93United_States_relations||, ||Japan%E2%80%93United_States_relations||, ||South_Korea%E2%80%93United_States_relations||, ||Israel%E2%80%93United_States_relations||, and several ||European_Union|| countries, including ||France%E2%80%93United_States_relations||, ||Italy%E2%80%93United_States_relations||, ||Germany%E2%80%93United_States_relations||, ||Spain%E2%80%93United_States_relations||, and ||Poland%E2%80%93United_States_relations||. It works closely with fellow ||NATO|| members on military and security issues and with its neighbors through the ||Organization_of_American_States|| and ||United_States_free_trade_agreements|| such as the trilateral ||United_States%E2%80%93Mexico%E2%80%93Canada_Agreement||. ||Colombia|| is traditionally considered by the United States as its most loyal ally in ||South_America||. The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for ||Federated_States_of_Micronesia||, the ||Marshall_Islands|| and ||Palau|| through the ||Compact_of_Free_Association||. Government finance See also: ||Taxation_in_the_United_States|| and ||United_States_federal_budget||  U.S. Government spending and revenue from 1792 to 2018 ||Taxation_in_the_United_States|| is ||Progressive_tax||, and is levied at the federal, state, and local government levels. This includes taxes on income, payroll, property, sales, imports, estates, and gifts, as well as various fees. Taxation in the United States is based on citizenship, not residency. Both non-resident citizens and ||Permanent_residence_(United_States)|| holders living abroad are taxed on their income irrespective of where they live or where their income is earned. The United States is one of the few countries in the world to do so. In 2010, taxes collected by federal, state and municipal governments amounted to 24.8% of ||Gross_domestic_product||. For 2018, the effective tax rate for the wealthiest 400 households was 23%, compared to 24.2% for the bottom half of U.S. households. During fiscal year 2012, the federal government spent $3.54 trillion on a budget or cash basis. Major categories of fiscal year 2012 spending included: Medicare & Medicaid (23%), Social Security (22%), Defense Department (19%), non-defense discretionary (17%), other mandatory (13%) and interest (6%). In 2018, the United States had the largest external debt in the world. As a percentage of GDP, it had the 34th largest government debt in the world in 2017; however, more recent estimates vary. The total ||National_debt_of_the_United_States|| was $23.201 trillion, or 107% of GDP, in the fourth quarter of 2019. By 2012, total federal debt had surpassed 100% of U.S. GDP. The U.S. has a ||Credit_rating|| of AA+ from ||Standard_%26_Poor%27s||, AAA from ||Fitch_Ratings||, and AAA from ||Moody%27s_Investors_Service||. Military Main article: ||United_States_Armed_Forces||  ||The_Pentagon||, near Washington, D.C., is home to the ||U.S._Department_of_Defense||. The president is the ||Commander-in-Chief_of_the_United_States|| of the ||United_States_Armed_Forces|| and appoints its leaders, the ||United_States_Secretary_of_Defense|| and the ||Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff||. The ||United_States_Department_of_Defense||, which is headquartered at ||The_Pentagon|| near Washington, D.C., administers five of the six service branches, which are made up of the ||United_States_Army||, ||United_States_Marine_Corps||, ||United_States_Navy||, ||United_States_Air_Force||, and ||United_States_Space_Force||. The ||United_States_Coast_Guard||, also a branch of the armed forces, is normally administered by the ||United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security|| in peacetime and can be transferred to the ||United_States_Department_of_the_Navy|| in wartime. In 2019, all six branches of the U.S. Armed Forces reported 1.4 million personnel on active duty. The ||Reserve_components_of_the_United_States_Armed_Forces|| and ||National_Guard_of_the_United_States|| brought the total number of troops to 2.3 million. The Department of Defense also employed about 700,000 civilians, not including ||Military-industrial_complex||.  The nuclear-powered ||Aircraft_carrier|| ||USS_George_Washington_(CVN_73)|| Military service in the United States is voluntary, although ||Conscription_in_the_United_States|| may occur in wartime through the ||Selective_Service_System||. From 1940 until 1973, conscription was mandatory even during peacetime. Today, American forces can be rapidly deployed by the Air Force's large fleet of ||Transport_aircraft||, the Navy's 11 active ||Aircraft_carrier||, and ||Marine_expeditionary_unit|| at sea with the Navy, and Army's ||XVIII_Airborne_Corps|| and ||75th_Ranger_Regiment|| deployed by Air Force transport aircraft. The Air Force can strike targets across the globe through its fleet of ||Strategic_bomber||, maintains the ||Air_defense|| across the United States, and provides ||Close_air_support|| to Army and Marine Corps ground forces. The Space Force operates the ||Global_Positioning_System||, operates the ||Eastern_Range|| and ||Western_Range_(USSF)|| for all space launches, and operates the United States' ||United_States_Space_Surveillance_Network|| and ||United_States_national_missile_defense|| networks. The military operates about 800 bases and facilities abroad, and maintains ||United_States_military_deployments|| in 25 foreign countries. The United States spent $649 billion on its military in 2019, 36% of global military spending. At 4.7% of GDP, the rate was the second-highest among the top 15 military spenders, after ||Saudi_Arabia||. Defense spending plays a major role in science and technology investment, with roughly half of U.S. federal research and development funded by the Department of Defense. Defense's share of the overall U.S. economy has generally declined in recent decades, from early ||Cold_War|| peaks of 14.2% of GDP in 1953 and 69.5% of federal spending in 1954 to 4.7% of GDP and 18.8% of federal spending in 2011. In total number of personnel, the United States has the third-largest combined armed forces in the world, behind the ||People%27s_Liberation_Army|| and ||Indian_Armed_Forces||. The United States is one of the five ||Nuclear_Non-Proliferation_Treaty|| ||Nuclear_weapons_states||, and one of nine countries to possess ||Nuclear_weapons||. It has the world's ||Nuclear_weapons_of_the_United_States||, after that of Russia. The United States also owns more than 40% of the world's 14,000 nuclear weapons. Law enforcement and crime Main articles: ||Law_enforcement_in_the_United_States|| and ||Crime_in_the_United_States|| See also: ||Law_of_the_United_States||, ||Human_rights_in_the_United_States#Justice_system||, ||Incarceration_in_the_United_States||, ||Sheriffs_in_the_United_States||, ||Police_brutality_in_the_United_States||, and ||Capital_punishment_in_the_United_States||  The ||New_York_City_Police_Department|| is the nation's largest municipal law enforcement agency. ||Law_enforcement_in_the_United_States|| is primarily the responsibility of local police departments and ||Sheriff||'s offices, with ||State_police|| providing broader services. ||Federal_law_enforcement_in_the_United_States|| such as the ||Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation|| (FBI) and the ||United_States_Marshals_Service|| have specialized duties, including protecting ||Civil_rights||, ||National_Security_of_the_United_States|| and enforcing ||U.S._federal_courts||' rulings and federal laws. According to the ||Bureau_of_Justice_Statistics||, and ||Charles_H._Ramsey||, former ||Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania|| police chief, appearing on ||Meet_the_Press||, there are about 18,000 U.S. police agencies in the United States. That number includes ||City_police|| departments, county sheriff's offices, state police/||Highway_patrol|| and federal law enforcement agencies. State courts conduct most criminal trials while ||Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States|| handle certain designated crimes as well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts. A cross-sectional analysis of the ||World_Health_Organization|| Mortality Database from 2010 showed that United States homicide rates "were 7.0 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25.2 times higher." In 2016, the U.S. murder rate was 5.4 per 100,000. Total incarceration in the United States by year (1920–2014) The United States has the ||United_States_incarceration_rate|| and ||Incarceration_in_the_United_States|| in the world. The Department of Justice said that the imprisonment rate for all prisoners sentenced to more than a year in state or federal facilities in 2019 stood at 419 per 100,000 residents which was at its lowest point since 1995 and that the total prison population for the same year stood at 1,430,800 which represented an 11% decrease in the population size from a decade earlier. Other sources such as the ||Prison_Policy_Initiative|| had put the aggregate number of prisoners in 2020 at 2.3 million. According to the ||Federal_Bureau_of_Prisons||, the majority of inmates held in federal prisons are convicted of drug offenses. Efforts to reduce the prison population include government policies and grassroots initiatives that ||Decarceration_in_the_United_States|| — recent examples include laws at the federal and state level such as the ||Fair_Sentencing_Act||, ||First_Step_Act||, Maryland's Justice Reinvestment Act and California's Money Bail Reform Act. About 9% of prisoners are held in ||Incarceration_in_the_United_States#Privatization||, a practice beginning in the 1980s and a subject of contention. On January 26, 2021, the Biden Administration signed an executive order that halted the renewal of federal government contracts with private prisons, but it did not apply to detention centers that held undocumented immigrants. Although most nations have abolished ||Capital_punishment||, it is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, and at the state level in 28 states, though three states have ||Moratorium_(law)|| on carrying out the penalty imposed by their governors. In 2019, the country had the sixth-highest number of executions in the world, following ||Capital_punishment_in_China||, ||Capital_punishment_in_Iran||, ||Capital_punishment_in_Saudi_Arabia||, ||Capital_punishment_in_Iraq||, and ||Capital_punishment_in_Egypt||. No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing in part to the 1972 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in ||Furman_v._Georgia|| that struck down the previous practice. Since the decision, however, there have been more than 1,500 executions, although 186 of those convicted and sentenced since Furman have been exonerated, as tabulated by the ||Death_Penalty_Information_Center||. In recent years, the number of executions and presence of capital punishment statute on whole has trended down nationally, with ||Capital_punishment_in_the_United_States#States_without_capital_punishment|| recently abolishing the penalty. Economy Main article: ||Economy_of_the_United_States|| See also: ||Economic_history_of_the_United_States||, ||List_of_companies_of_the_United_States_by_state||, ||List_of_largest_companies_in_the_United_States_by_revenue||, and ||Lists_of_companies||  A proportional representation of United States exports, 2019  The ||New_York_Stock_Exchange|| on ||Wall_Street|| in New York City According to the ||International_Monetary_Fund||, the U.S. GDP of $22.7 trillion constitutes 24% of the ||Gross_world_product|| at market exchange rates and over 16% of the gross world product at ||Purchasing_power_parity||. On February 2, 2022, the United States had a ||National_debt|| of $30 trillion. The United States is the ||List_of_countries_by_imports|| of goods and ||List_of_countries_by_exports||, though ||List_of_countries_by_exports_per_capita|| are relatively low. In 2010, the total ||Foreign_trade_of_the_United_States|| was $635 billion. Canada, China, Mexico, Japan, and the European Union are its top trading partners. From 1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded annual GDP growth was 3.3%, compared to a 2.3% weighted average for the rest of the ||G7||. The country ranks fifth in the world in ||List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita|| and seventh in ||List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita||. The ||United_States_dollar|| is the world's primary ||Reserve_currency||. In 2009, the ||Private_sector|| was estimated to constitute 86.4% of the economy. While its economy has reached a ||Post-industrial_society|| level of development, the United States remains an industrial power. In August 2010, the American labor force consisted of 154.1 million people (50%). With 21.2 million people, the ||Public_sector|| is the leading field of employment. The largest private employment sector is health care and social assistance, with 16.4 million people. It has a smaller ||Welfare_state|| and redistributes less income through government action than most other ||World_Bank_high-income_economy|| countries. The United States is the only ||Advanced_economy|| that does not ||List_of_statutory_minimum_employment_leave_by_country|| and is one of a few countries in the world without ||Paid_family_leave|| as a legal right. Some 74% of full-time American workers get paid sick leave, according to the ||Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics||, although only 24% of part-time workers get the same benefits. Science and technology Main articles: ||Science_and_technology_in_the_United_States|| and ||Science_policy_of_the_United_States||  ||Buzz_Aldrin|| on the Moon, 1969 The United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing ||Interchangeable_parts|| were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories during the first half of the 19th century. This technology, along with the establishment of a ||Machine_tool|| industry, enabled the U.S. to have large-scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles, and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the ||American_system_of_manufacturing||. Factory ||Electrification|| in the early 20th century and introduction of the ||Assembly_line|| and other labor-saving techniques created the system of ||Mass_production||. In the 21st century, approximately two-thirds of research and development funding comes from the private sector. The United States leads the world in scientific research papers and ||Impact_factor||. In 1876, ||Alexander_Graham_Bell|| was awarded the first U.S. ||Invention_of_the_telephone||. ||Thomas_Edison||'s ||Research_institute||, one of the first of its kind, developed the ||Phonograph||, the first ||Incandescent_light_bulb||, and the first viable ||Kinetoscope||. The latter led to emergence of the worldwide ||Show_business||. In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of ||Ransom_E._Olds|| and ||Henry_Ford|| popularized the assembly line. The ||Wright_brothers||, in 1903, made the ||Wright_Flyer||. The rise of ||Fascism|| and ||Nazism|| in the 1920s and 30s led many European scientists, including ||Albert_Einstein||, ||Enrico_Fermi||, and ||John_von_Neumann||, to immigrate to the United States. During World War II, the ||Manhattan_Project|| developed nuclear weapons, ushering in the ||Atomic_Age||, while the ||Space_Race|| produced rapid advances in rocketry, ||Materials_science||, and ||Aeronautics||. The invention of the ||Transistor|| in the 1950s, a key active component in practically all modern ||Electronics||, led to many technological developments and a significant expansion of the U.S. technology industry. This, in turn, led to the establishment of many new technology companies and regions around the country such as ||Silicon_Valley|| in California. Advancements by American ||Microprocessor|| companies such as ||Advanced_Micro_Devices|| (AMD) and ||Intel||, along with both computer ||Software|| and ||Computer_hardware|| companies such as ||Adobe_Systems||, ||Apple_Inc.||, ||IBM||, ||Microsoft||, and ||Sun_Microsystems||, created and popularized the ||Personal_computer||. The ||ARPANET|| was developed in the 1960s to meet ||United_States_Department_of_Defense|| requirements, and became the first of a ||History_of_the_Internet|| into the ||Internet||. The United States ranked third in the ||Global_Innovation_Index|| in 2021, after Switzerland and Sweden. Income, wealth, and poverty Further information: ||Income_in_the_United_States||, ||Poverty_in_the_United_States||, ||Affluence_in_the_United_States||, ||United_States_counties_by_per_capita_income||, and ||Income_inequality_in_the_United_States|| Accounting for 4.24% of the ||World_population||, Americans collectively possess 29.4% of the world's total wealth, the largest percentage of any country. The U.S. also ranks first in the number of ||Billionaire|| and ||Millionaire|| in the world, with 724 billionaires and 10.5 million millionaires as of 2020. Prior to the 2019–2021 global ||COVID-19_pandemic||, ||Credit_Suisse|| listed some 18.6 million U.S. citizens as having a net worth in excess of $1 million. In 2020, the Food Security Index ranked the United States 11th in food security, giving the country a score of 77.5/100. Americans on average have more than twice as much living space per dwelling and per person as ||European_Union|| residents. For 2019, the ||United_Nations_Development_Programme|| ranked the United States 17th among 189 countries in its ||Human_Development_Index#2014_report|| (HDI) and 28th among 151 countries in its ||Inequality-adjusted_Human_Development_Index|| (IHDI).  ||Wealth_inequality_in_the_United_States|| in the U.S. increased between 1989 and 2013. ||Wealth_in_the_United_States||, like income and taxes, is ||Wealth_inequality_in_the_United_States||; the richest 10% of the adult population possess 72% of the country's household wealth, while the bottom half possess only 2%. According to the Federal Reserve, the top 1% controlled 38.6% of the country's wealth in 2016. According to a 2018 study by the OECD, the United States has a larger percentage of low-income workers than almost any other developed nation, largely because of a weak ||Collective_bargaining|| system and lack of government support for at-risk workers. After years of stagnation, median household income reached a record high in 2016 following two consecutive years of record growth. Income inequality remains at record highs however, with the top fifth of earners taking home more than half of all overall income. The rise in the share of total annual income received by the top one percent, which has more than doubled from nine percent in 1976 to 20 percent in 2011, has significantly affected ||Income_inequality_in_the_United_States||, leaving the United States with one of the widest income distributions among OECD members. The ||Upper_class|| accounted for 52 percent of the income gains from 2009 to 2015, where income is defined as market income excluding government transfers. The extent and relevance of income inequality is a matter of debate. There were about 567,715 sheltered and unsheltered ||Homelessness_in_the_United_States|| in January 2019, with almost two-thirds staying in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program Attempts to combat homelessness include the ||Section_8_(housing)|| housing voucher program and implementation of the ||Housing_First|| strategy across all levels of government. In 2011, ||Hunger_in_the_United_States#Children||, about 35% more than 2007 levels, though only 845,000 U.S. children (1.1%) saw reduced food intake or disrupted eating patterns at some point during the year, and most cases were not chronic. As of June 2018, 40 million people, roughly 12.7% of the U.S. population, were living in poverty, including 13.3 million children. Of those impoverished, 18.5 million live in deep poverty (family income below one-half of the poverty threshold) and over five million live "in '||Third_World||' conditions". In 2017, the U.S. states or territories with the lowest and highest ||List_of_U.S._states_by_poverty_rate|| were ||New_Hampshire|| (7.6%) and ||American_Samoa|| (65%), respectively. The economic impact and ||Unemployment_in_the_United_States|| caused by the ||COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States|| raised fears of a mass ||Eviction_in_the_United_States||, with an analysis by the ||Aspen_Institute|| indicating that between 30 and 40 million people were at risk for eviction by the end of 2020. While the CDC and the Biden government issued a federal eviction moratorium, the Supreme Court invalidated the order, ruling they lacked the authority under federal law to do so. Transportation Main article: ||Transportation_in_the_United_States|| See also: ||Air_transportation_in_the_United_States|| and ||Rail_transportation_in_the_United_States||  The ||Interstate_Highway_System|| in the ||Contiguous_United_States||, which extends 46,876 miles (75,440 km) Personal transportation is dominated by automobiles, which operate on a network of 4 million miles (6.4 million kilometers) of public roads. The United States has the world's second-largest automobile market, and has the highest vehicle ownership per capita in the world, with 816.4 vehicles per 1,000 Americans (2014). In 2017, there were 255,009,283 non-two wheel motor vehicles, or about 910 vehicles per 1,000 people. The ||List_of_airlines_of_the_United_States|| is entirely privately owned and has been largely ||Airline_Deregulation_Act||, while ||List_of_airports_in_the_United_States|| are publicly owned. The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based; ||American_Airlines|| is number one after its 2013 acquisition by ||US_Airways||. Of the ||List_of_the_world%27s_busiest_airports_by_passenger_traffic||, 16 are in the United States, including the busiest, ||Hartsfield%E2%80%93Jackson_Atlanta_International_Airport||. The United States has the ||List_of_countries_by_rail_transport_network_size|| in the world, nearly all ||Standard-gauge_railway||. The network handles mostly freight, with intercity passenger service provided by the government-subsidized ||Amtrak|| to all but four states. Transportation is the largest single source of ||Greenhouse_gas_emissions_by_the_United_States|| in the United States. The country ranks as the world's second-highest emitter of greenhouse gases, exceeded only by ||Greenhouse_gas_emissions_by_China||. The United States had been the world's largest producer of greenhouse gases and ranks third, tied with Canada, for ||List_of_countries_by_greenhouse_gas_emissions_per_capita||. Energy Further information: ||Energy_policy_of_the_United_States|| As of 2019, the United States receives approximately 80% of its energy from fossil fuels. In 2019, the largest source of the country's energy came from ||Petroleum|| (36.6%), followed by ||Natural_gas|| (32%), ||Coal|| (11.4%), renewable sources (11.4%) and ||Nuclear_power|| (8.4%). Americans constitute less than 5% of the ||World_population||, but consume 17% of the ||Energy_use_in_the_United_States|| They account for about 25% of the world's ||Oil_consumption||, while producing only 6% of the world's annual petroleum supply.

The ||United_States_Census_Bureau|| reported 331,449,281 residents as of April 1, 2020. This figure, like most official data for the United States as a whole, excludes the five unincorporated territories (||Puerto_Rico||, ||Guam||, the ||U.S._Virgin_Islands||, ||American_Samoa||, and the ||Northern_Mariana_Islands||) and minor island possessions. According to the Bureau's ||U.S._and_World_Population_Clock||, on January 28, 2021, the U.S. population had a net gain of one person every 100 seconds, or about 864 people per day. The United States is the ||List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population|| in the world, after China and India. In 2020, the ||Median_age|| of the United States population was 38.5 years. In 2018, there were almost 90 million immigrants and ||Second-generation_immigrants_in_the_United_States|| in the United States, accounting for 28% of the overall U.S. population. The United States has a diverse population; 37 ||American_ancestries|| have more than one million members. ||White_Americans|| of European ancestry, mostly ||German_Americans||, ||Irish_Americans||, ||English_Americans||, ||Italian_Americans||, ||Polish_Americans|| and ||French_Americans||, including ||White_Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans|| from ||Latin_America||, form the largest ||Race_(human_classification)||, at 73.1% of the population. ||African_Americans|| constitute the nation's largest ||Minority_group|| and third-largest ancestry group, and are around 13% of the total U.S. population. ||Asian_Americans|| are the country's second-largest racial minority (the three largest Asian ethnic groups are ||Chinese_Americans||, ||Filipino_Americans||, and ||Indian_Americans||). In 2017, out of the U.S. foreign-born population, some 45% (20.7 million) were naturalized citizens, 27% (12.3 million) were lawful permanent residents, 6% (2.2 million) were temporary lawful residents, and 23% (10.5 million) were unauthorized immigrants. Among living immigrants to the U.S., the top five countries of birth are Mexico, China, India, the Philippines and ||El_Salvador||. Until 2017, the United States led the world in ||Refugee_resettlement|| for decades, admitting more refugees than the rest of the world combined. About 82% of Americans live in ||United_States_urban_area||, including suburbs; about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000. In 2008, 273 ||List_of_United_States_cities_by_population|| had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four cities had over two million (namely ||New_York_City||, ||Los_Angeles||, ||Chicago||, and ||Houston||). Many U.S. metropolitan populations are growing rapidly, particularly in the South and West. As of 2018, 52% of Americans age 15 and over were married, 6% were widowed, 10% were divorced, and 32% had never been married. As of 2020, the ||Total_fertility_rate|| stood at 1.64 children per woman. In 2013, the average age at first birth was 26, and 41% of births were to unmarried women. In 2019, the U.S. had the world's highest rate (23%) of children living in ||Single_parents_in_the_United_States|| households; the rates in Canada and Mexico were 15% and 7%, respectively. Language Main article: ||Languages_of_the_United_States|| English (specifically, ||American_English||) is the ||De_facto|| ||National_language|| of the United States. Although there is no ||Official_language|| at the federal level, some laws—such as ||Naturalized_citizen_of_the_United_States||—standardize English, and most states have declared English as the official language. Three states and four U.S. territories have recognized local or indigenous languages in addition to English, including ||Hawaii|| (||Hawaiian_language||), ||Alaska|| (||Alaska_Native_languages||), ||South_Dakota|| (||Sioux_language||), ||American_Samoa|| (||Samoan_language||), ||Puerto_Rico|| (||Spanish_language||), ||Guam|| (||Chamorro_language||), and the ||Northern_Mariana_Islands|| (||Carolinian_language|| and Chamorro). In Puerto Rico, Spanish is more widely spoken than English. According to the ||American_Community_Survey||, in 2010 some 229 million people (out of the total U.S. population of 308 million) spoke only English at home. More than 37 million spoke ||Spanish_language_in_the_United_States|| at home, making it the second most commonly used language in the United States. Other languages spoken at home by one million people or more include ||Chinese_language|| (2.8 million), ||Tagalog_language|| (1.6 million), ||Vietnamese_language|| (1.4 million), ||French_language|| (1.3 million), ||Korean_language|| (1.1 million), and ||German_language|| (1 million). The ||List_of_most_commonly_learned_foreign_languages_in_the_United_States|| in the United States, in terms of enrollment numbers from kindergarten through university ||Undergraduate_education||, are Spanish (around 7.2 million students), French (1.5 million), and ||German_language_in_the_United_States|| (500,000). Other commonly taught languages include ||Latin||, ||Japanese_language_education_in_the_United_States||, ||American_Sign_Language||, ||Italian_language_in_the_United_States||, and ||Chinese_language_in_the_United_States||. About 18% of all Americans claim to speak both English and another language. Religion Main article: ||Religion_in_the_United_States||  Percentage of respondents in the United States saying that religion is "very important" or "somewhat important" in their lives (2014) The ||First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution|| of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the ||Free_Exercise_Clause|| of religion and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting its ||Establishment_Clause||. The United States has the ||Christianity_by_country||. In a 2014 survey, 70.6% of adults in the United States identified themselves as ||Christianity_in_the_United_States||; ||Protestantism|| in general accounted for 46.5%, while ||Catholic_Church_in_the_United_States||, at 20.8%, formed the largest single Christian denomination. In 2014, 5.9% of the U.S. adult population claimed a non-Christian religion. These include ||American_Jews|| (1.9%), ||Islam_in_the_United_States|| (1.1%), ||Hinduism_in_the_United_States|| (0.7%), and ||Buddhism_in_the_United_States|| (0.7%). The survey also reported that 22.8% of Americans described themselves as ||Agnosticism||, ||Atheism|| or simply having ||Irreligion||—up from 8.2% in 1990. Membership in a house of worship fell from 70% in 1999 to 47% in 2020, much of the decline related to the number of Americans expressing no religious preference. However, membership also fell among those who identified with a specific religious group. ||Protestantism_in_the_United_States|| is the largest Christian religious grouping in the United States, accounting for almost half of all Americans. ||Baptists|| collectively form the largest branch of Protestantism at 15.4%, and the ||Southern_Baptist_Convention|| is the largest individual Protestant denomination at 5.3% of the U.S. population. Apart from Baptists, other Protestant categories include ||Nondenominational_Protestants||, ||Methodists||, ||Pentecostals||, unspecified Protestants, ||Lutherans||, ||Presbyterians||, ||Congregationalists||, ||Episcopalians||/||Anglicans||, ||Quakers||, ||Adventists||, ||Holiness_movement||, ||Christian_fundamentalists||, ||Anabaptists||, ||Pietists||, and ||List_of_Protestant_churches||. The ||Bible_Belt|| is an informal term for a region in the ||Southern_United_States|| in which socially conservative ||Evangelical_Protestantism|| is a significant part of the culture and Christian church attendance across the denominations is generally higher than the nation's average. By contrast, religion plays the least important role in ||New_England|| and in the ||Western_United_States||. Health See also: ||Health_care_in_the_United_States||, ||Health_care_reform_in_the_United_States||, and ||Health_insurance_in_the_United_States|| The ||Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention|| (CDC) reported that the United States had an average ||Life_expectancy|| at birth of 77.3 years in 2020 (74.5 years for men and 80.2 years for women), down 1.5 years from 2019. According to provisional figures, this was the lowest average U.S. life expectancy recorded by the CDC since 2003, the first overall decline since 2018, and "the largest one-year decline since World War II." Some three-quarters of the decrease was attributed to deaths from the ||COVID-19_pandemic||, with most of the rest due to accidents and drug overdoses. The country also has one of the highest ||Suicide_in_the_United_States|| rates among wealthy countries. Starting in 1998, the average life expectancy in the U.S. fell behind that of other wealthy industrialized countries, and Americans' "health disadvantage" gap has been increasing ever since. From 1999 to 2019, more than 770,000 Americans ||United_States_drug_overdose_death_rates_and_totals_over_time||. Life expectancy was highest among Asians and Hispanics and lowest among blacks.  The ||Texas_Medical_Center|| in downtown ||Houston|| is the largest medical complex in the world. Increasing ||Obesity_in_the_United_States|| and improvements in health and longevity outside the U.S. contributed to lowering the country's rank in life expectancy from 11th in the world in 1987 to 42nd in 2007. In 2017, the United States had the lowest life expectancy among Japan, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and seven nations in western Europe. Obesity rates have more than doubled in the last 30 years and are the highest in the industrialized world. Approximately one-third of the adult population is obese and an additional third is overweight. Obesity-related ||Diabetes_mellitus_type_2|| is considered epidemic by health care professionals. In 2010, ||Coronary_artery_disease||, ||Lung_cancer||, ||Stroke||, ||Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease||, and traffic collisions caused the most years of life lost in the U.S. ||Low_back_pain||, ||Major_depressive_disorder||, ||Musculoskeletal_disorder||, ||Neck_pain||, and ||Anxiety|| caused the most years lost to disability. The most harmful ||Risk_factor|| were poor diet, ||Tobacco_smoking||, obesity, ||Hypertension||, ||Hyperglycemia||, ||Physical_inactivity||, and alcohol use. ||Alzheimer%27s_disease||, ||Substance_use_disorder||, ||Kidney_disease||, ||Cancer||, and falls caused the most additional years of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates. U.S. teenage pregnancy and abortion rates are substantially higher than in other Western nations, especially among blacks and Hispanics. Government-funded health care coverage for the poor (||Medicaid||, established in 1965) and for those age 65 and older (||Medicare_(United_States)||, begun in 1966) is available to Americans who meet the programs' income or age qualifications. The United States is the only developed nation without a system of universal health care and the reasons for this and extent to which it is a problem is ||Healthcare_reform_in_the_United_States|| Similarly, a significant proportion of the population does not carry health insurance and the reasons for and extent to which it is a problem is also a ||Health_insurance_coverage_in_the_United_States#Causes|| In 2010, former President Obama passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (also known as the Affordable Care Act or ACA) which ushered in the most sweeping set of reforms to America's health care system in nearly five decades since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid. The CDC said that the law roughly halved the uninsured share of the population and multiple studies have concluded that ACA had reduced the mortality of enrollees but its legacy ||Criticism_of_Obamacare||. The U.S. health care system far ||List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_(PPP)_per_capita|| that of any other nation, measured both in per capita spending and as a percentage of GDP but attains worse healthcare outcomes when compared to peer nations. However, the U.S. is a global leader in medical innovation. Education Main articles: ||Education_in_the_United_States|| and ||Higher_education_in_the_United_States||  The ||University_of_Virginia||, founded by ||Thomas_Jefferson||, is one of the many public colleges and universities in the United States. Some 80% of U.S. college students attend these institutions. American ||State_school|| is operated by state and local governments and regulated by the ||United_States_Department_of_Education|| through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of five or six (beginning with ||Kindergarten|| or ||First_grade||) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through ||Twelfth_grade||, the end of ||High_school||); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17. About 12% of children are enrolled in ||Parochial_school|| or ||Nonsectarian|| ||Private_school||. 3.4% of children are ||Homeschooling_in_the_United_States|| as of 2012. The U.S. spends more on education per student than any nation in the world, spending an average of $12,794 per year on public elementary and secondary school students in the 2016–2017 school year. Some 80% of U.S. college students attend ||Public_university||. Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a ||Bachelor%27s_degree||, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees. The basic ||Literacy|| rate is approximately 99%. The United Nations assigns the United States an Education Index of 0.97, tying it for 12th in the world. The United States has many private and public ||Lists_of_American_institutions_of_higher_education||. The majority of the world's top universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the U.S. There are also local ||Community_college|| with generally more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition. In 2018, ||Universitas_21||, a network of research-intensive universities, ranked the United States first in the world for breadth and quality of higher education, and 15th when GDP was a factor. As for ||Public_expenditure|| on higher education, the U.S. trails some other ||Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development|| (Organization for Cooperation and Development) nations but spends more per student than the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and private spending. Despite some student ||Loan_forgiveness|| programs in place, ||Student_debt|| has increased by 102% in the last decade, and exceeded 1.7 trillion dollars as of 2021. Culture Main article: ||Culture_of_the_United_States||  For many immigrants, the ||Statue_of_Liberty|| was their first view of the United States. A gift from ||France||, the statue signified new opportunities in life, and thus the statue is an iconic symbol of the ||American_Dream|| as well as its ideals. The United States is home to ||Multiculturalism|| and a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values. Aside from the ||Native_Americans_in_the_United_States||, ||Native_Hawaiians||, and ||Alaska_Natives|| populations, nearly all Americans or their ancestors immigrated or were imported as slaves within the past five centuries. Mainstream American culture is a ||Western_culture|| largely derived from the ||European_American|| with influences from many other sources, such as ||African-American_culture||. More recent immigration from ||Asian_American|| and especially ||Latin_American_culture|| has added to a cultural mix that has been described as a homogenizing ||Melting_pot||, with immigrants contributing to, and often ||Assimilation_(phonology)|| into, ||Mainstream|| American culture. Americans have traditionally been characterized by a strong ||Work_ethic||, competitiveness, and individualism, as well as a unifying belief in an "||American_civil_religion||" emphasizing liberty, equality, private property, democracy, rule of law, and a preference for limited government. Americans are extremely charitable by global standards: according to a 2006 British study, Americans gave 1.67% of GDP to charity, more than any other nation studied. The ||American_Dream||, or the perception that Americans enjoy high ||Socio-economic_mobility_in_the_United_States||, plays a key role in attracting immigrants. Whether this perception is accurate has been a topic of debate. While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a ||Classless_society||, scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting ||Socialization||, language, and values. Americans tend to greatly value ||Socioeconomics|| achievement, but being ||Average_Joe|| is also generally seen as a positive attribute. Literature, philosophy, and visual art Main articles: ||American_literature||, ||American_philosophy||, ||Architecture_of_the_United_States||, and ||Visual_art_of_the_United_States||  ||Mark_Twain||, American author and ||Humorist|| In the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe, contributing to ||Western_culture||. Writers such as ||Washington_Irving||, ||Nathaniel_Hawthorne||, ||Edgar_Allan_Poe||, and ||Henry_David_Thoreau|| established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. ||Mark_Twain|| and poet ||Walt_Whitman|| were major figures in the century's second half; ||Emily_Dickinson||, virtually unknown during her lifetime, is recognized as an essential American poet. A work seen as capturing fundamental aspects of the national experience and character—such as ||Herman_Melville||'s ||Moby-Dick|| (1851), Twain's ||Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn|| (1885), ||F._Scott_Fitzgerald||'s ||The_Great_Gatsby|| (1925) and ||Harper_Lee||'s ||To_Kill_a_Mockingbird|| (1960)—may be dubbed the "||Great_American_Novel||." Thirteen U.S. citizens have won the ||Nobel_Prize_in_Literature||. ||William_Faulkner||, ||Ernest_Hemingway|| and ||John_Steinbeck|| are often named among the most influential writers of the 20th century. Popular literary genres such as the ||Western_fiction|| and ||Hardboiled|| crime fiction developed in the United States. The ||Beat_Generation|| writers opened up new literary approaches, as have ||Postmodern_literature|| authors such as ||John_Barth||, ||Thomas_Pynchon||, and ||Don_DeLillo||. The ||Transcendentalism||, led by Thoreau and ||Ralph_Waldo_Emerson||, established the first major ||American_philosophy||. After the Civil War, ||Charles_Sanders_Peirce|| and then ||William_James|| and ||John_Dewey|| were leaders in the development of ||Pragmatism||. In the 20th century, the work of ||Willard_Van_Orman_Quine|| and ||Richard_Rorty||, and later ||Noam_Chomsky||, brought ||Analytic_philosophy|| to the fore of American philosophical academia. ||John_Rawls|| and ||Robert_Nozick|| also led a revival of ||Political_philosophy||. In the visual arts, the ||Hudson_River_School|| was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European ||Realism_(arts)||. The 1913 ||Armory_Show|| in New York City, an exhibition of European ||Modern_art||, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene. ||Georgia_O%27Keeffe||, ||Marsden_Hartley||, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic movements such as the ||Abstract_expressionism|| of ||Jackson_Pollock|| and ||Willem_de_Kooning|| and the ||Pop_art|| of ||Andy_Warhol|| and ||Roy_Lichtenstein|| developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and then ||Postmodernism|| has brought fame to American architects such as ||Frank_Lloyd_Wright||, ||Philip_Johnson||, and ||Frank_Gehry||. Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of ||Photography||, with major photographers including ||Alfred_Stieglitz||, ||Edward_Steichen||, ||Edward_Weston||, and ||Ansel_Adams||. Food Main article: ||Cuisine_of_the_United_States||  Roasted ||Turkey_(bird)|| is a traditional menu item of an American ||Thanksgiving_(United_States)|| dinner. Early settlers were introduced by Native Americans to such indigenous, non-European foods as turkey, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup. They and later immigrants combined these with foods they had known, such as wheat flour, beef, and milk to create a distinctive American cuisine. Homegrown foods are part of a shared national menu on one of America's most popular holidays, ||Thanksgiving_(United_States)||, when many Americans make or purchase traditional foods to celebrate the occasion. The American ||Fast_food|| industry, the world's largest, pioneered the ||Drive-through|| format in the 1940s. Characteristic American dishes such as ||Apple_pie||, ||Fried_chicken||, ||Doughnuts||, ||French_fries||, ||Macaroni_and_cheese||, ||Ice_cream||, ||Pizza||, ||Hamburgers||, and ||Hot_dogs|| derive from the recipes of various immigrants. ||Mexican_cuisine|| dishes such as ||Burritos|| and ||Tacos|| and ||Pasta|| dishes freely adapted from ||Italian_cuisine|| sources are widely consumed. Americans drink three times as much coffee as tea. Marketing by U.S. industries is largely responsible for making orange juice and milk standard ||Breakfast|| ||Drink||. Music Main article: ||Music_of_the_United_States||  ||Grammy_Museum_at_L.A._Live|| Among America's earliest composers was a man named ||William_Billings|| who, born in Boston, composed patriotic hymns in the 1770s; Billings was a part of the ||Yankee_tunesmiths||, who dominated American music during its earliest stages. ||Anthony_Heinrich|| was the most prominent composer before the Civil War. From the mid- to late 1800s, ||John_Philip_Sousa|| of the late ||Romantic_music|| composed numerous military songs—||List_of_marches_by_John_Philip_Sousa||—and is regarded as one of America's greatest composers. By the late 19th century, the ||Second_New_England_School|| (sometimes referred to specifically as the "Boston Six") became prominent representatives of the classical tradition, of whom ||John_Knowles_Paine|| was the leading figure. Although little known at the time, ||Charles_Ives||' work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as ||Henry_Cowell|| and ||John_Cage|| created a distinctive American approach to classical composition. ||Aaron_Copland|| and ||George_Gershwin||—eventually furthered by ||Leonard_Bernstein||—developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music.  (2:50) The 1942 ||Jazz|| instrumental "||Main_Stem||" by ||Duke_Ellington||, performed by the ||U.S._Army_Band|| in 2010 Problems playing this file? See . The rhythmic and lyrical styles of ||African-American_music|| have deeply influenced ||Music_of_the_United_States|| at large, distinguishing it from European and African traditions. Elements from ||Folk_music|| idioms such as the ||Blues|| and what is known as ||Old-time_music|| were adopted and transformed into ||Popular_music|| with global audiences. ||Jazz|| was developed by innovators such as ||Louis_Armstrong|| and ||Duke_Ellington|| early in the 20th century. ||Country_music|| developed in the 1920s, and ||Rhythm_and_blues|| in the 1940s. ||Elvis_Presley|| and ||Chuck_Berry|| were among the mid-1950s pioneers of ||Rock_and_roll||. Rock bands such as ||Metallica||, the ||Eagles_(band)||, and ||Aerosmith|| are among the ||List_of_best-selling_music_artists|| in worldwide sales. In the 1960s, ||Bob_Dylan|| emerged from the ||American_folk_music_revival|| to become one of America's most celebrated songwriters, and ||James_Brown|| led the development of ||Funk||. More recent American creations include ||Hip_hop_music||, ||Salsa_music||, ||Techno_music||, and ||House_music||. Mid-20th-century American pop stars such as ||Bing_Crosby||, ||Frank_Sinatra||, and Elvis Presley became global celebrities, as have artists of the late 20th century such as ||Michael_Jackson||, ||Prince_(musician)||, ||Madonna|| and ||Whitney_Houston||. Popular artists from the mid-1990s to late 2000s include ||Mariah_Carey||, ||Britney_Spears||, ||Justin_Timberlake||, ||Christina_Aguilera|| and ||Beyonc%C3%A9||. Well-known American singers of the 2010s include ||Katy_Perry||, ||Bruno_Mars||, ||Lady_Gaga||, ||Taylor_Swift|| and ||Ariana_Grande||. Cinema Main article: ||Cinema_of_the_United_States||  The ||Hollywood_Sign|| in ||Los_Angeles||, California ||Hollywood,_Los_Angeles||, a northern district of ||Los_Angeles||, California, is one of the leaders in motion picture production. The world's first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using ||Thomas_Edison||'s ||Kinetoscope||. Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization. Director ||D._W._Griffith||, an American ||Filmmaker|| during the ||Silent_film|| period, was central to the development of ||Film_grammar||, and producer/entrepreneur ||Walt_Disney|| was a leader in both ||Animation|| and movie ||Merchandising||. Directors such as ||John_Ford|| redefined the image of the American Old West, and, like others such as ||John_Huston||, broadened the possibilities of cinema with location shooting. The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the "||Classical_Hollywood_cinema||", from the early sound period until the early 1960s, with screen actors such as ||John_Wayne|| and ||Marilyn_Monroe|| becoming iconic figures. In the 1970s, "||New_Hollywood||" or the "Hollywood Renaissance" was defined by grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the ||Aftermath_of_World_War_II||. In more recent times, directors such as ||Steven_Spielberg|| and ||George_Lucas|| have gained renown for their blockbuster films, often characterized by high production costs and earnings. Notable films topping the ||American_Film_Institute||'s ||AFI%27s_100_Years...100_Movies|| list include ||Orson_Welles||'s ||Citizen_Kane|| (1941), which is frequently cited as the greatest film of all time, ||Casablanca_(film)|| (1942), ||The_Godfather|| (1972), ||Gone_with_the_Wind_(film)|| (1939), ||Lawrence_of_Arabia_(film)|| (1962), ||The_Wizard_of_Oz_(1939_film)|| (1939), ||The_Graduate|| (1967), ||On_the_Waterfront|| (1954), ||Schindler%27s_List|| (1993), ||Singin%27_in_the_Rain|| (1952), ||It%27s_a_Wonderful_Life|| (1946) and ||Sunset_Boulevard_(film)|| (1950). The ||Academy_Awards||, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the ||Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences|| since 1929, and the ||Golden_Globe_Award|| have been held annually since January 1944. Theater Main article: ||Theater_in_the_United_States|| Theater in the United States is part of the old European theatrical tradition and has been heavily influenced by the ||Theatre_of_the_United_Kingdom||. The central hub of the American theater scene has been ||Manhattan||, with its divisions of ||Broadway_theatre||, ||Off-Broadway||, and ||Off-Off-Broadway||. Many movie and television stars have gotten their big break working in New York productions. Outside New York City, many cities have professional ||Regional_theater_in_the_United_States|| that produce their own seasons, with some works being produced regionally with hopes of eventually moving to New York. U.S. theater also has an active ||Community_theater|| culture, which relies mainly on local volunteers who may not be actively pursuing a theatrical career. Sports Main article: ||Sports_in_the_United_States|| See also: ||Professional_sports_leagues_in_the_United_States|| The most popular sports in the U.S. are ||American_football||, ||Basketball||, ||Baseball|| and ||Ice_hockey||. ||American_football|| is by several measures the most popular spectator sport in the United States; the ||National_Football_League|| (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the ||Super_Bowl|| is watched by tens of millions globally. Even on the ||Collegiate_athletics|| level, college football games receive millions of viewers per television broadcast; most notably the ||College_Football_Playoff||, which averages 25 million viewers. ||Baseball|| has been regarded as the U.S. ||National_sport|| since the late 19th century, with ||Major_League_Baseball|| (MLB) being the top league. ||Basketball|| and ||Ice_hockey|| are the country's next two ||Major_professional_sports_leagues_in_the_United_States_and_Canada||, with the top leagues being the ||National_Basketball_Association|| (NBA) and the ||National_Hockey_League|| (NHL). ||College_football|| and ||College_basketball|| attract large audiences. The ||NCAA_Division_I_Men%27s_Basketball_Tournament|| is one of the most watched sporting events. In ||Association_football|| (a sport that has gained a footing in the United States since the mid-1990s), the country hosted the ||1994_FIFA_World_Cup||, the ||United_States_men%27s_national_soccer_team|| qualified for ||United_States_at_the_FIFA_World_Cup|| and the ||United_States_women%27s_national_soccer_team|| ||United_States_at_the_FIFA_Women%27s_World_Cup|| the ||FIFA_Women%27s_World_Cup|| four times; ||Major_League_Soccer|| is the sport's highest league in the United States (featuring 23 American and three Canadian teams). The market for professional sports in the United States is roughly $69 billion, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined. Eight ||Olympic_Games|| have taken place in the United States. The ||1904_Summer_Olympics|| in ||St._Louis||, ||Missouri||, were the first-ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe. As of 2021, the United States has won 2,629 medals at the ||Summer_Olympic_Games||, more than any other country, and 330 in the ||Winter_Olympic_Games||, the second most behind Norway. While most major U.S. sports such as ||Baseball|| and ||American_football|| have evolved out of European practices, ||Basketball||, ||Volleyball||, ||Skateboarding||, and ||Snowboarding|| are American inventions, some of which have become popular worldwide. ||Lacrosse|| and ||Surfing|| arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate Western contact. The most-watched ||Individual_sport|| are ||Golf|| and ||Auto_racing||, particularly ||NASCAR|| and ||IndyCar||. Mass media Further information: ||Mass_media_in_the_United_States|| See also: ||Newspapers_in_the_United_States||, ||Television_in_the_United_States||, ||Internet_in_the_United_States||, and ||Radio_in_the_United_States||  The headquarters of the ||National_Broadcasting_Company|| (NBC) at ||30_Rockefeller_Plaza|| in New York City The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the ||NBC|| (NBC), ||CBS|| (CBS), ||American_Broadcasting_Company|| (ABC), and ||Fox_Broadcasting_Company|| (FOX). The four major broadcast ||Television_network|| are all commercial entities. ||Cable_television_in_the_United_States|| offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches. Americans listen to radio programming, also largely commercial, on average just over two and a half hours a day. In 1998, the number of U.S. commercial radio stations had grown to 4,793 AM stations and 5,662 FM stations. In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations. Most of these stations are run by universities and public authorities for educational purposes and are financed by public or private funds, subscriptions, and corporate underwriting. Much public radio broadcasting is supplied by ||NPR||. NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the ||Public_Broadcasting_Act_of_1967||; its television counterpart, ||PBS||, was created by the same legislation. As of September 30, 2014, there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the U.S. ||Federal_Communications_Commission|| (FCC). Well-known newspapers include ||The_Wall_Street_Journal||, ||The_New_York_Times||, and ||USA_Today||. Although the cost of publishing has increased over the years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major wire service, such as the ||Associated_Press|| or ||Reuters||, for their national and world coverage. With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as ||Gannett_Company|| or ||The_McClatchy_Company||, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have "alternative weeklies" to complement the mainstream daily papers, such as New York City's ||The_Village_Voice|| or Los Angeles' ||LA_Weekly||. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups. The five most popular websites used in the U.S. are ||Google||, ||YouTube||, ||Amazon_(company)||, ||Yahoo||, and ||Facebook||. More than 800 publications are produced in Spanish, the second most commonly used language in the United States behind English. See also ||Index_of_United_States%E2%80%93related_articles|| ||Lists_of_U.S._state_topics|| ||Outline_of_the_United_States|| Notes  English is the ||Official_language_of_the_United_States|| of 32 states; English and ||Hawaiian_language|| are both official languages in ||Hawaii||, and English and ||Alaska_Native_languages|| are official in ||Alaska||. ||Algonquian_languages||, ||Cherokee_language||, and ||Sioux_language|| are among many other official languages in Native-controlled lands throughout the country. ||French_language|| is a de facto, but unofficial, language in ||Maine|| and ||Louisiana||, while ||New_Mexico|| law grants ||Spanish_language|| a special status. In five territories, English as well as one or more indigenous languages are official: ||Spanish_language|| in Puerto Rico, ||Samoan_language|| in American Samoa, and ||Chamorro_language|| in both Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. ||Carolinian_language|| is also an official language in the Northern ||Mariana_Islands||.  The historical and informal demonym ||Yankee|| has been applied to Americans, New Englanders, or northeasterners since the 18th century. ^ The United States is the third-largest country, after Russia and Canada, if coastal and territorial waters are included. If excluded, it is the fourth-largest, after Russia, Canada, and China. Coastal/territorial waters included: 3,796,742 sq mi (9,833,517 km) Coastal/territorial waters excluded: 3,696,100 sq mi (9,572,900 km)  Excludes ||Puerto_Rico|| and the other ||Unincorporated_territories_of_the_United_States|| because they are counted separately in ||United_States_census|| statistics.    See ||Time_in_the_United_States|| for details about laws governing time zones in the United States.    See ||Date_and_time_notation_in_the_United_States||.  A single jurisdiction, the ||United_States_Virgin_Islands||, uses left-hand traffic.    The five major territories are ||American_Samoa||, ||Guam||, the ||Northern_Mariana_Islands||, ||Puerto_Rico||, and the ||United_States_Virgin_Islands||. There are eleven smaller island areas without permanent populations: ||Baker_Island||, ||Howland_Island||, ||Jarvis_Island||, ||Johnston_Atoll||, ||Kingman_Reef||, ||Midway_Atoll||, and ||Palmyra_Atoll||. U.S. sovereignty over ||Bajo_Nuevo_Bank||, ||Navassa_Island||, ||Serranilla_Bank||, and ||Wake_Island|| is disputed.  The United States has a maritime border with the ||United_Kingdom|| because the ||U.S._Virgin_Islands|| borders the ||British_Virgin_Islands||. ||Puerto_Rico|| has a maritime border with the ||Dominican_Republic||. ||American_Samoa|| has a maritime border with the ||Cook_Islands|| (see ||Cook_Islands%E2%80%93United_States_Maritime_Boundary_Treaty||). American Samoa also has maritime borders with ||Samoa|| and ||Niue||.  The ||United_States_Census_Bureau|| also provides a continuously updated but unofficial population clock in addition to its decennial census and annual population estimates:   People born in American Samoa are non-citizen U.S. nationals, unless one of their parents is a U.S. citizen. In 2019, a court ruled that American Samoans are U.S. citizens, but the litigation is onging.  ||Inupiaq_language||, ||Central_Siberian_Yupik_language||, ||Central_Alaskan_Yup%27ik_language||, ||Alutiiq_language||, ||Aleut_language|| (Aleut), ||Dena%CA%BCina_language||, ||Deg_Xinag_language||, ||Holikachuk_language||, ||Koyukon_language||, ||Upper_Kuskokwim_language||, ||Gwich%CA%BCin_language||, ||Lower_Tanana_language||, ||Upper_Tanana_language||, ||Tanacross_language||, ||H%C3%A4n_language||, ||Ahtna_language||, ||Eyak_language||, ||Tlingit_language||, ||Haida_language||, and ||Coast_Tsimshian_dialect||.
