Dubbed the "||Honorific_nicknames_in_popular_music||", he is regarded as ||Cultural_impact_of_Michael_Jackson||. Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in ||Popular_culture||. Jackson influenced artists across many music genres; through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance moves such as the ||Moonwalk_(dance)||, to which he gave the name, as well as the ||Robot_(dance)||. He is the ||List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Michael_Jackson|| in history. The eighth child of the ||Jackson_family||, Jackson made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers ||Jackie_Jackson||, ||Tito_Jackson||, ||Jermaine_Jackson||, and ||Marlon_Jackson|| as a member of ||The_Jackson_5|| (later known as the Jacksons). Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at ||Motown||. He became a solo star with his 1979 album ||Off_the_Wall||. His ||Michael_Jackson_videography||, including those for "||Beat_It||", "||Billie_Jean||", and "||Thriller_(song)||" from his 1982 album ||Thriller_(album)||, are credited with breaking ||Anti-black_racism_in_the_United_States|| and transforming the medium into an artform and promotional tool. He helped propel the success of ||MTV|| and continued to innovate with videos for the albums ||Bad_(album)|| (1987), ||Dangerous_(Michael_Jackson_album)|| (1991), and ||HIStory:_Past,_Present_and_Future,_Book_I|| (1995). Thriller became the ||List_of_best-selling_albums||, while Bad was the first album to produce five U.S. ||Billboard_Hot_100|| number-one singles. From the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to his ||Health_and_appearance_of_Michael_Jackson||, ||Personal_relationships_of_Michael_Jackson||, behavior, and lifestyle. In 1993, he was ||1993_child_sexual_abuse_accusations_against_Michael_Jackson|| of a family friend. The lawsuit was settled out of civil court; Jackson was not indicted due to lack of evidence. In 2005, he was ||Trial_of_Michael_Jackson|| of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. The ||FBI_files_on_Michael_Jackson|| found no evidence of criminal conduct on Jackson's behalf in either case. In 2009, while preparing for a series of comeback concerts, ||This_Is_It_(concert_residency)||, Jackson ||Death_of_Michael_Jackson|| from an overdose of ||Propofol|| administered by his personal physician, ||Conrad_Murray||, who was ||California_v._Murray|| of ||Involuntary_manslaughter||. Jackson is one of the ||List_of_best-selling_music_artists|| of all time, with estimated sales of over 400 million records worldwide. He had 13 ||List_of_artists_by_number_of_Billboard_Hot_100_number-one_singles|| (more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era) and was the first artist to have a top-ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades. He is regarded by the ||Recording_Industry_Association_of_America|| as the highest-selling individual music artist worldwide. His honors include 15 ||Grammy_Awards||, 6 ||Brit_Awards||, a ||Golden_Globe_Award||, and 39 ||Guinness_World_Records||, including the "Most Successful Entertainer of All Time". Jackson's inductions include the ||List_of_Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame_inductees|| (twice), the ||Vocal_Group_Hall_of_Fame||, the ||Songwriters_Hall_of_Fame||, the ||National_Museum_of_Dance_and_Hall_of_Fame|| (the only recording artist to be inducted), and the ||Rhythm_and_Blues_Music_Hall_of_Fame||. In 2016, his estate earned $825 million, the highest yearly amount for a celebrity ever recorded by ||Forbes||. Contents Life and career Early life and the Jackson 5 (1958–1975)  Jackson's childhood home in ||Gary,_Indiana||, pictured in March 2010 with floral tributes after his death Michael Joseph Jackson was born in ||Gary,_Indiana||, near ||Chicago||, on August 29, 1958. He was the eighth of ten children in the ||Jackson_family||, a working-class ||African_Americans|| family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. His mother, ||Katherine_Jackson|| (née Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a ||Country_music|| performer, and worked part-time at ||Sears||. She was a ||Jehovah%27s_Witness||. His father, ||Joe_Jackson_(manager)||, a former boxer, was a crane operator at ||U.S._Steel|| and played guitar with a local ||Rhythm_and_blues|| band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income. Joe's great-grandfather, July "Jack" Gale, was a US Army ||Cavalry_scout||; family lore held that he was also a Native American ||Medicine_man||. Michael grew up with three sisters (||Rebbie_Jackson||, ||La_Toya_Jackson||, and ||Janet_Jackson||) and five brothers (||Jackie_Jackson||, ||Tito_Jackson||, ||Jermaine_Jackson||, ||Marlon_Jackson||, and ||Randy_Jackson_(The_Jacksons)||). A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth. In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father which included Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing ||Conga|| and ||Tambourine||. Michael said his father told him he had a "fat nose", and physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals. He recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to punish any mistakes. Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael. Katherine said that although whipping came to be considered abuse, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael was growing up. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon denied that their father was abusive and said that the whippings, which were harder on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble. Jackson said his youth was lonely and isolated. Later in 1964, Michael began sharing lead vocals with Jermaine, and the group's name was changed to ||The_Jackson_5||. In 1965, the group won a talent show; Michael performed the dance to ||Robert_Parker_(singer)||'s 1965 song "||Barefootin%27_(song)||" and sang ||The_Temptations||' "||My_Girl_(The_Temptations_song)||". From 1966 to 1968, the Jacksons 5 toured the ||Midwestern_United_States||; they frequently played at a string of black clubs known as the ||Chitlin%27_Circuit|| as the opening act for artists such as ||Sam_%26_Dave||, ||The_O%27Jays||, ||Gladys_Knight||, and ||Etta_James||. The Jackson 5 also performed at clubs and cocktail lounges, where ||Striptease|| shows were featured, and at local auditoriums and high school dances. In August 1967, while touring the ||Eastern_United_States||, they won a weekly amateur night concert at the ||Apollo_Theater|| in ||Harlem||.  Jackson (center) as a member of the Jackson 5 in 1972. The group were among the first ||African_Americans|| performers to attain a crossover following. The Jackson 5 recorded several songs for a Gary record label, ||Steeltown_Records||; their first single, "||Big_Boy_(song)||", was released in 1968. Bobby Taylor of ||Bobby_Taylor_%26_the_Vancouvers|| brought the Jackson 5 to ||Motown|| after they opened for Taylor at Chicago's ||Regal_Theater,_Chicago|| in 1968. Taylor produced some of their early Motown recordings, including a version of "||Who%27s_Lovin%27_You||". After signing with Motown, the Jackson family relocated to Los Angeles. In 1969, Motown executives decided ||Diana_Ross|| should introduce the Jackson 5 to the public—partly to bolster her career in television—sending off what was considered Motown's last product of its "production line". The Jackson 5 made their first television appearance in 1969 in the ||Miss_Black_America|| pageant, performing a cover of "||It%27s_Your_Thing||". ||Rolling_Stone|| later described the young Michael as "a prodigy" with "overwhelming musical gifts" who "quickly emerged as the main draw and lead singer". In January 1970, "||I_Want_You_Back||" became the first Jackson 5 song to reach number one on the US ||Billboard_Hot_100||; it stayed there for four weeks. Three more singles with Motown topped the chart: "||ABC_(The_Jackson_5_song)||", "||The_Love_You_Save||", and "||I%27ll_Be_There_(The_Jackson_5_song)||". In May 1971, the Jackson family moved into a large house on a two-acre estate in ||Encino,_Los_Angeles||. During this period, Michael developed from a child performer into a ||Teen_idol||. Between 1972 and 1975, he released four solo studio albums with Motown: ||Got_to_Be_There|| (1972), ||Ben_(album)|| (1972), ||Music_%26_Me|| (1973), and ||Forever,_Michael|| (1975). "||Got_to_Be_There_(song)||" and "||Ben_(song)||", the title tracks from his first two solo albums, sold well as singles, as did a cover of ||Bobby_Day||'s "||Rockin%27_Robin_(song)||". Michael maintained ties to the Jackson 5. The Jackson 5 were later described as "a cutting-edge example of black ||Crossover_music||". They were frustrated by Motown's refusal to allow them creative input. Jackson's performance of their top five single "||Dancing_Machine||" on ||Soul_Train|| popularized the ||Robot_(dance)||. Move to Epic and Off the Wall (1975–1981)  The Jackson siblings in 1977, without Jermaine. From left, back row: ||Jackie_Jackson||, Michael, ||Tito_Jackson||, ||Marlon_Jackson||. Middle row: ||Randy_Jackson_(Jacksons_singer)||, ||La_Toya_Jackson||, ||Rebbie_Jackson||. Front row: ||Janet_Jackson|| (1977). In 1975, the Jackson 5 left Motown. They signed with ||Epic_Records||, a subsidiary of ||Sony_Music||, and renamed themselves the Jacksons. Their younger brother Randy joined the band around this time; Jermaine stayed with Motown and pursued a solo career. The Jacksons continued to tour internationally, and released six more albums between 1976 and 1984. Michael, the group's main songwriter during this time, wrote songs such as "||Shake_Your_Body_(Down_to_the_Ground)||" (1978), "||This_Place_Hotel||" (1980), and "||Can_You_Feel_It_(The_Jacksons_song)||" (1980). In 1977, Jackson moved to New York City to star as the ||Scarecrow_(Oz)|| in ||The_Wiz_(film)||, a musical directed by ||Sidney_Lumet||. It costarred ||Diana_Ross||, ||Nipsey_Russell||, and Ted Ross. The film was a box-office failure. Its score was arranged by ||Quincy_Jones||, who later produced three of Jackson's solo albums. During his time in New York, Jackson frequented the ||Studio_54|| nightclub, where he heard early ||Hip_hop_music||; this influenced his ||Beatboxing|| on future tracks such as "||Working_Day_and_Night||". In 1978, Jackson broke his nose during a dance routine. A ||Rhinoplasty|| led to breathing difficulties that later affected his career. He was referred to ||Steven_Hoefflin||, who performed Jackson's operations. Jackson's fifth solo album, ||Off_the_Wall|| (1979), established him as a solo performer and helped him move from the ||Bubblegum_music|| pop of his youth to more complex sounds. It produced four top 10 entries in the US: "||Off_the_Wall_(Michael_Jackson_song)||", "||She%27s_Out_of_My_Life||", and the chart-topping singles "||Don%27t_Stop_%27Til_You_Get_Enough||" and "||Rock_with_You_(Michael_Jackson_song)||". The album reached number three on the US ||Billboard_200|| and sold over 20 million copies worldwide. In 1980, Jackson won three ||American_Music_Award|| for his solo work: Favorite Soul/R&B Album, Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist, and Favorite Soul/R&B Single for "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough". He also won a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for 1979 with "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough". In 1981, Jackson was the American Music Awards winner for Favorite Soul/R&B Album and Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist. Jackson felt Off the Wall should have made a bigger impact, and was determined to exceed expectations with his next release. In 1980, he secured the highest ||Royalties|| rate in the music industry: 37 percent of wholesale album profit. Thriller and Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever (1982–1983)  The sequined jacket and white glove worn by Jackson at ||Motown_25:_Yesterday,_Today,_Forever||. ||British_Vogue|| called Jackson "a fashion pioneer [...] who gave new meaning to ||Moonwalk_(dance)||, immortalised solitary, [and] sparkly gloves". Jackson recorded with ||Queen_(band)|| singer ||Freddie_Mercury|| from 1981 to 1983, recording demos of "||State_of_Shock_(song)||", "Victory" and "||There_Must_Be_More_to_Life_Than_This||". The recordings were intended for an album of duets but, according to Queen's manager ||Jim_Beach||, the relationship soured when Jackson brought a ||Llama|| into the recording studio, and Jackson was upset by Mercury's drug use. The songs were released in 2014. Jackson went on to record "State of Shock" with ||Mick_Jagger|| for the Jacksons' album ||Victory_(The_Jacksons_album)|| (1984). In 1982, Jackson contributed "Someone in the Dark" to the ||E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial_(album)||. Jackson's sixth album, ||Thriller_(Michael_Jackson_album)||, was released in late 1982. It was the best-selling album worldwide in 1983, and became the best-selling album of all time in the US and the ||List_of_best-selling_albums||, selling an estimated 70 million copies. It topped the Billboard 200 chart for 37 weeks and was in the top 10 of the 200 for 80 consecutive weeks. It was the first album to produce seven Billboard Hot 100 top-10 singles, including "||Billie_Jean||", "||Beat_It||", and "||Wanna_Be_Startin%27_Somethin%27||". On March 25, 1983, Jackson reunited with his brothers for ||Motown_25:_Yesterday,_Today,_Forever||, an NBC television special. The show aired on May 16 to an estimated audience of 47 million, and featured the Jacksons and other Motown stars. Jackson's solo performance of "Billie Jean" earned him his first ||Emmy_Award|| nomination. Wearing a glove decorated with ||Rhinestone||, he debuted his ||Moonwalk_(dance)||, which ||Jeffrey_Daniel|| had taught him three years earlier, and it became his signature dance in his repertoire. Jackson had originally turned down the invitation to the show, believing he had been doing too much television. But at the request of Motown founder ||Berry_Gordy||, he performed in exchange for an opportunity to do a solo performance. Rolling Stone reporter Mikal Gilmore called the performance "extraordinary". Jackson's performance drew comparisons to ||Elvis_Presley||'s and ||The_Beatles||' appearances on ||The_Ed_Sullivan_Show||. ||Anna_Kisselgoff|| of The New York Times praised the perfect timing and technique involved in the dance. Gordy described being "mesmerized" by the performance. At the ||26th_Annual_Grammy_Awards||, Thriller won eight awards, and Jackson won an award for the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial storybook. Winning eight Grammys in one ceremony is a record he holds with the band ||Santana_(band)||. Jackson and Quincy Jones won the award for Producer of the Year (Non-Classical). Thriller won Album of the Year (with Jackson as the album's artist and Jones as its co-producer), and the single won Best Pop Vocal Performance (Male) award for Jackson. "Beat It" won Record of the Year and Best Rock Vocal Performance (Male). "Billie Jean" won two Grammy awards: Best R&B Song and Best R&B Vocal Performance (Male), with Jackson as songwriter and singer respectively. Thriller won the Grammy for Best Engineered Recording (Non Classical), acknowledging ||Bruce_Swedien|| for his work on the album. At the ||American_Music_Awards_of_1984||, Jackson won another eight awards and became the youngest artist to win the Award of Merit. He also won Favorite Male Artist, Favorite Soul/R&B Artist, and Favorite Pop/Rock Artist. "Beat It" won Favorite Soul/R&B Video, Favorite Pop/Rock Video and Favorite Pop/Rock Single. The album won Favorite Soul/R&B Album and Favorite Pop/Rock Album. Thriller's sales doubled after the release of an extended music video, ||Michael_Jackson%27s_Thriller_(music_video)||, which sees Jackson dancing with a horde of zombies. The success transformed Jackson into a dominant force in global pop culture, and cemented his status as the "king of pop". Jackson had the highest royalty rate in the music industry at that point, with about $2 for every album sold (equivalent to $5 in 2020), and was making record-breaking profits. Dolls modeled after Jackson appeared in stores in May 1984 for $12 each. In the same year, The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller, a documentary about the music video, won a Grammy for Best Music Video (Longform). Time described Jackson's influence at that point as "star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and color too." The New York Times wrote "in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else". On May 14, 1984, President ||Ronald_Reagan|| gave Jackson an award recognizing his support of alcohol and drug abuse charities, and in recognition of his support for the ||Ad_Council||'s and the ||National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_Administration||'s Drunk Driving Prevention campaign. Jackson allowed the campaign to use "Beat It" for its public service announcements.||Ronald_Reagan|| and ||Nancy_Reagan|| shortly before presenting Jackson with the award at the ||White_House|| on May 14, 1984Jackson inside the White House with the Reagans Pepsi, "We Are the World", and business career (1984–1985) In November 1983, Jackson and his brothers partnered with ||PepsiCo|| in a $5 million promotional deal that broke records for a celebrity endorsement (equivalent to $12,991,981 in 2020). The first Pepsi campaign, which ran in the US from 1983 to 1984 and launched its "New Generation" theme, included tour sponsorship, public relations events, and in-store displays. Jackson helped to create the advertisement, and suggested using his song "Billie Jean", with revised lyrics, as its ||Jingle||. On January 27, 1984, Michael and other members of the Jacksons filmed a Pepsi commercial overseen by ||Phil_Dusenberry||, a ||BBDO|| ad agency executive, and ||Alan_Pottasch||, Pepsi's Worldwide Creative Director, at the ||Shrine_Auditorium|| in Los Angeles. During a simulated concert before a full house of fans, pyrotechnics accidentally set Jackson's hair on fire, causing ||Burn|| to his scalp. Jackson underwent treatment to hide the scars and had his third rhinoplasty shortly thereafter. Pepsi settled out of court, and Jackson donated the $1.5 million settlement to the ||Southern_California_Hospital_at_Culver_City|| in ||Culver_City,_California||; its now closed Michael Jackson Burn Center was named in his honor. Jackson signed a second agreement with Pepsi in the late 1980s for $10 million. The second campaign covered 20 countries and provided financial support for Jackson's Bad album and 1987–88 world tour. Jackson had endorsements and advertising deals with other companies, such as ||LA_Gear||, ||Suzuki||, and ||Sony||, but none were as significant as his deals with Pepsi. The ||Victory_Tour_(The_Jacksons_tour)|| of 1984 headlined the Jacksons and showcased Jackson's new solo material to more than two million Americans. It was the last tour he did with his brothers. Following ||Victory_Tour_(The_Jacksons_tour)#Ticket_controversy_and_other_business_issues||, Jackson donated his share of the proceeds, an estimated $3 to 5 million, to charity. During the last concert of the Victory Tour at the ||Dodger_Stadium|| in Los Angeles, Jackson announced his split from The Jacksons during "Shake Your Body". His charitable work continued with the release of "||We_Are_the_World||" (1985), co-written with ||Lionel_Richie||, which raised money for the poor in the US and Africa. It earned $63 million (equivalent to $151,593,750 in 2020), and became one of the ||List_of_best-selling_singles||, with 20 million copies sold. It won four Grammy Awards in 1985, including Song of the Year for Jackson and Richie as its writers. The project's creators received two special American Music Awards honors: one for the creation of the song and another for the ||USA_for_Africa|| idea. Jackson, Jones, and promoter Ken Kragen received special awards for their roles in the song's creation.  Jackson signing a "||We_Are_the_World||" poster in 1985 Jackson collaborated with ||Paul_McCartney|| in the early 1980s, and learned that McCartney was making $40 million a year from owning the rights to other artists' songs. By 1983, Jackson had begun buying publishing rights to others' songs, but he was careful with his acquisitions, only bidding on a few of the dozens that were offered to him. Jackson's early acquisitions of ||Music_catalog|| and song copyrights such as the ||Sly_Stone|| collection included "Everyday People" (1968), ||Len_Barry||'s "||1-2-3_(Len_Barry_song)||" (1965), and ||Dion_DiMucci||'s "||The_Wanderer_(Dion_song)||" (1961) and "||Runaround_Sue||" (1961). In 1984, ||Robert_Holmes_%C3%A0_Court|| announced he was selling the ||Sony/ATV_Music_Publishing#Acquisition|| catalog comprising the publishing rights to nearly 4000 songs, including most of the Beatles' material. In 1981, McCartney had been offered the catalog for £20 million ($40 million). Jackson submitted a bid of $46 million on November 20, 1984. When Jackson and McCartney were unable to make a joint purchase, McCartney did not want to be the sole owner of the Beatles' songs, and did not pursue an offer on his own. Jackson's agents were unable to come to a deal, and in May 1985 left talks after having spent more than $1 million and four months of ||Due_diligence|| work on the negotiations. In June 1985, Jackson and Branca learned that ||Charles_Koppelman||'s and ||Martin_Bandier||'s The Entertainment Company had made a tentative offer to buy ATV Music for $50 million; in early August, Holmes à Court contacted Jackson and talks resumed. Jackson's increased bid of $47.5 million (equivalent to $114,296,875 in 2020) was accepted because he could close the deal more quickly, having already completed due diligence. Jackson agreed to visit Holmes à Court in Australia, where he would appear on the ||Channel_Seven_Perth_Telethon||. Jackson's purchase of ATV Music was finalized on August 10, 1985. Changing appearance, tabloids, and films (1986–1987) See also: ||Health_and_appearance_of_Michael_Jackson|| Jackson's skin had been medium-brown during his youth, but from the mid-1980s gradually grew paler. The change drew widespread media coverage, including speculation that he had been ||Skin_whitening||. Jackson's dermatologist, ||Arnold_Klein||, said he observed in 1983 that Jackson had ||Vitiligo||, a condition characterized by patches of the skin losing their pigment, and sensitivity to sunlight. He also identified ||Discoid_lupus_erythematosus|| in Jackson. He diagnosed Jackson with lupus that year, and with vitiligo in 1986. Vitiligo's drastic effects on the body can cause psychological distress. Jackson used fair-colored makeup, and possibly skin-bleaching prescription creams, to cover up the uneven blotches of color caused by the illness. The creams would have further lightened his skin, and, with the application of makeup, he could appear very pale. Jackson said he had not purposely bleached his skin and could not control his vitiligo, adding, "When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, it hurts me." He became friends with Klein and Klein's assistant, ||Debbie_Rowe||. Rowe later became Jackson's second wife and the mother of his first two children. In his 1988 autobiography and a 1993 interview, Jackson said he had had two ||Rhinoplasty|| surgeries and a ||Cleft_chin|| surgery but no more than that. He said he lost weight in the early 1980s because of a change in diet to achieve a dancer's body. Witnesses reported that he was often dizzy, and speculated he was suffering from ||Anorexia_nervosa||. Periods of weight loss became a recurring problem later in his life. After his death, Jackson's mother said that he first turned to ||Plastic_surgery#Cosmetic_surgery_procedures|| to remedy his vitiligo, because he did not want to look like a "spotted cow". She said he had received more than the two cosmetic surgeries he claimed and speculated that he had become addicted to them. In 1986, ||Tabloid_journalism|| reported that Jackson slept in a ||Hyperbaric_medicine|| to slow aging, and pictured him lying in a glass box. The claim was untrue, and tabloids reported that he spread the story himself. They also reported that Jackson took female hormone shots to keep his voice high and facial hair wispy, proposed to ||Elizabeth_Taylor|| and possibly had a shrine of her, and had cosmetic surgery on his eyes. Jackson's manager ||Frank_DiLeo|| denied all of them, except for Jackson having a chamber. DiLeo added "I don't know if he sleeps in it. I'm not for it. But Michael thinks it's something that's probably healthy for him. He's a bit of a health fanatic." When Jackson took his pet chimpanzee ||Bubbles_(chimpanzee)|| to tour in Japan, the media portrayed Jackson as an aspiring ||Disney|| cartoon character who befriended animals. It was also reported that Jackson had offered to buy the bones of ||Joseph_Merrick|| (the "Elephant Man"). In June 1987, the ||Chicago_Tribune|| reported Jackson's publicist bidding $1 million for the skeleton to the ||London_Hospital_Medical_College|| on his behalf. The college maintained the skeleton was not for sale. DiLeo said Jackson had an "absorbing interest" in Merrick, "purely based on his awareness of the ethical, medical and historical significance." These tabloid stories inspired the name "Wacko Jacko", which Jackson came to despise. According to music journalist ||Joseph_Vogel||, the demeaning name first appeared in British tabloid ||The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)|| in 1985. The name's origins come from ||Jacco_Macacco||, the name of a famous monkey used in ||Monkey-baiting|| matches at the Westminster Pit in the early 1820s. "Jacko" was used in ||Rhyming_slang|| to refer to monkeys in general, hence a racist connotation behind the name. In 1987, Rolling Stone described Jackson as "the flighty-genius star-child, a celebrity virtually all his life, who dwells in a fairy-tale kingdom of fellow celebrities, animals, mannequins and cartoons, who provides endless fodder for the tabloids.... But it’s the same child in Michael who inspires the artistry that fuels all the subsidiary industries, who turns his primal fears and fantasies into wondrous, hyperkinetic and emotional music." Jackson worked with ||George_Lucas|| and ||Francis_Ford_Coppola|| on the 17-minute $30 million ||3D_film|| ||Captain_EO||, which ran from 1986 at ||Disneyland|| and ||Epcot||, and later at ||Tokyo_Disneyland|| and ||Disneyland_Park_(Paris)||. After having been removed in the late 1990s, it returned to the theme park for several years after Jackson's death. In 1987, Jackson disassociated himself from the Jehovah's Witnesses. Katherine Jackson said this might have been because some Witnesses strongly opposed the Thriller video. Michael had denounced it in a Witness publication in 1984. Bad, autobiography, and Neverland (1987–1990)  Jackson and ||President_George_H._W._Bush|| at the White House on April 5, 1990. It was the second time that Jackson had been honored by a ||President_of_the_United_States||. Jackson's first album in five years, ||Bad_(album)|| (1987), was highly anticipated, with the industry expecting another major success. It became the first album to produce five US number-one singles: "||I_Just_Can%27t_Stop_Loving_You||", "||Bad_(Michael_Jackson_song)||", "||The_Way_You_Make_Me_Feel||", "||Man_in_the_Mirror||", and "||Dirty_Diana||". Another song, "||Smooth_Criminal||", peaked at number seven. Bad won the 1988 Grammy for Best Engineered Recording – Non Classical and the 1990 ||Grammy_Award_for_Best_Music_Video||, Short Form for "||Leave_Me_Alone_(Michael_Jackson_song)||".

By 2012, it had sold between 30 and 45 million copies worldwide. The ||Bad_(tour)|| world tour ran from September 12, 1987, to January 14, 1989. In Japan, the tour had 14 sellouts and drew 570,000 people, nearly tripling the previous record for a single tour. The 504,000 people who attended seven sold-out shows at ||Wembley_Stadium_(1923)|| set a new ||Guinness_World_Record||. In 1988, Jackson released his autobiography, ||Moonwalk_(book)||, with input from Stephen Davis and ||Jacqueline_Kennedy_Onassis||. It sold 200,000 copies, and reached the top of the New York Times bestsellers list. Jackson discussed his childhood, the Jackson 5, and the abuse from his father. He attributed his changing facial appearance to three plastic surgeries, puberty, weight loss, a strict vegetarian diet, a change in hairstyle, and stage lighting. In October, Jackson released a film, ||Moonwalker||, which featured live footage and short films starring Jackson and ||Joe_Pesci||. In the US it was released ||Direct-to-video|| and became the best-selling video cassette. The RIAA certified it as eight time Platinum. In March 1988, Jackson purchased 2,700 acres (11 km) of land near ||Santa_Ynez,_California||, to build a new home, ||Neverland_Ranch||, at a cost of $17 million (equivalent to $37,200,056 in 2020). He installed a ||Ferris_wheel||, a ||Carousel||, a movie theater and a zoo. A security staff of 40 patrolled the grounds. Shortly afterwards, he appeared in the first Western television advertisement in the ||Soviet_Union||. Jackson became known as the "||Honorific_nicknames_in_popular_music||", a nickname that Jackson's publicists embraced. When ||Elizabeth_Taylor|| presented him with the Soul Train Heritage Award in 1989, she called him "the true king of pop, rock and soul." President ||George_H._W._Bush|| designated him the White House's "Artist of the Decade". From 1985 to 1990, Jackson donated $455,000 to the ||United_Negro_College_Fund||, and all profits from his single "Man in the Mirror" went to charity. His rendition of "You Were There" at Sammy Davis Jr.'s 60th birthday celebration won Jackson a second Emmy nomination. Jackson was the bestselling artist of the 1980s. Dangerous, Heal the World Foundation, and Super Bowl XXVII halftime show (1991–1993) In March 1991, Jackson renewed his contract with Sony for $65 million (equivalent to $123,504,764 in 2020), a record-breaking deal, beating ||Neil_Diamond||'s renewal contract with ||Columbia_Records||. In 1991, he released his eighth album, ||Dangerous_(Michael_Jackson_album)||, co-produced with ||Teddy_Riley||. It was certified eight times platinum in the US, and by 2018 had sold 32 million copies worldwide. In the US, the first single, "||Black_or_White||", was the album's highest-charting song; it was number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for seven weeks and achieved similar chart performances worldwide. The second single, "||Remember_the_Time||" peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. At the end of 1992, Dangerous was the best-selling album of the year worldwide and "Black or White" the best-selling single of the year worldwide at the ||Billboard_Music_Award||. In 1993, he performed "Remember the Time" at the ||Soul_Train_Music_Awards|| in a chair, saying he twisted his ankle during dance rehearsals. In the UK, "||Heal_the_World||" made No. 2 on the charts in 1992.  Jackson during the ||Dangerous_World_Tour|| in 1993. ||Dangerous_(Michael_Jackson_album)|| has been recognized by writers as an influence on contemporary pop and R&B artists. Jackson founded the ||Heal_the_World_Foundation|| in 1992. The charity brought underprivileged children to Jackson's ranch to use the theme park rides, and sent millions of dollars around the globe to help children threatened by war, poverty, and disease. That July, Jackson published his second book, ||Dancing_the_Dream||, a collection of poetry. The ||Dangerous_World_Tour|| ran between June 1992 and November 1993 and grossed $100 million (equivalent to $179,152,269 in 2020); Jackson performed for 3.5 million people in 70 concerts, all of which were outside the US. Part of the proceeds went to Heal the World Foundation. Jackson sold the broadcast rights of the tour to ||HBO|| for $20 million, a record-breaking deal that still stands. Following the death of ||HIV/AIDS|| spokesperson and friend ||Ryan_White||, Jackson pleaded with the Clinton administration at ||First_inauguration_of_Bill_Clinton|| to give more money to HIV/AIDS charities and research and performed "||Gone_Too_Soon||", a song dedicated to White, and "Heal the World" at the gala. Jackson visited Africa in early 1992; on his first stop in Gabon he was greeted by more than 100,000 people, some of them carrying signs that read "Welcome Home Michael", and was awarded an Officer of the ||National_Order_of_Merit_(Gabon)|| from President ||Omar_Bongo||. During his trip to Ivory Coast, Jackson was crowned "King Sani" by a tribal chief. He thanked the dignitaries in French and English, signed documents formalizing his kingship, and sat on a golden throne while presiding over ceremonial dances. In January 1993, Jackson performed at the ||Super_Bowl_XXVII|| halftime show in Pasadena, California. The NFL sought a big-name artist to keep ratings high during halftime following dwindling audience figures. It was the first Super Bowl whose half-time performance drew greater audience figures than the game. Jackson played "||Jam_(song)||", "Billie Jean", "Black or White", and "Heal the World". Dangerous rose 90 places in the album chart after the performance. Jackson gave ||Michael_Jackson_Talks_..._to_Oprah|| with ||Oprah_Winfrey|| on February 10, 1993. He spoke of his childhood abuse at the hands of his father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood, and said that he often cried from loneliness. He denied tabloid rumors that he had bought the bones of the Elephant Man, slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, or bleached his skin, and stated for the first time that he had vitiligo. Dangerous re-entered the album chart in the top 10, more than a year after its release. In January 1993, Jackson won three ||American_Music_Awards||: Favorite Pop/Rock Album (Dangerous), Favorite Soul/R&B Single ("Remember the Time"), and was the first to win the International Artist Award of Excellence. In February, he won the "Living Legend Award" at the ||35th_Annual_Grammy_Awards|| in Los Angeles. He attended the award ceremony with ||Brooke_Shields||. Dangerous was nominated for Best Vocal Performance (for "Black or White"), Best R&B Vocal Performance ("Jam") and Best R&B Song ("Jam"), and Swedien and Riley won the award for Best Engineered – Non Classical. First child sexual abuse accusations and first marriage (1993–1995) Main article: ||1993_child_sexual_abuse_accusations_against_Michael_Jackson|| In August 1993, Jackson was accused of ||Child_sexual_abuse|| by a 13-year-old boy, Jordan Chandler, and his father, Evan Chandler. Jordan said he and Jackson had engaged in acts of kissing, ||Masturbation|| and ||Oral_sex||. While Jordan's mother initially told police that she did not believe Jackson had molested him, her position wavered a few days later. Evan was recorded discussing his intention to pursue charges, which Jackson used to argue that he was the victim of a jealous father trying to extort money. Jackson's older sister La Toya accused him of being a pedophile; she later retracted this, saying she had been forced into it by her abusive husband. Police raided Jackson's home in August and found two legal large-format art books featuring young boys playing, running and swimming in various states of undress. Jackson denied knowing of the books' content and claimed if they were there someone had to send them to him and he did not open them. Jordan Chandler gave police a description of Jackson's genitals. A strip search was made, and the jurors felt the description was not a match. In January 1994, Jackson settled with the Chandlers out of court for a reported total sum of $23 million. The police never pressed criminal charges. Citing a lack of evidence without Jordan's testimony, the state closed its investigation on September 22, 1994. Jackson had been taking ||Painkiller|| for his reconstructive scalp surgeries, administered due to the Pepsi commercial accident in 1984, and became dependent on them to cope with the stress of the sexual abuse allegations. On November 12, 1993, Jackson canceled the remainder of the Dangerous Tour due to health problems, stress from the allegations and painkiller addiction. He thanked close friend ||Elizabeth_Taylor|| for support, encouragement and counsel. The end of the tour concluded his relationship with Pepsi-Cola which sponsored the tour. In late 1993, Jackson proposed to ||Lisa_Marie_Presley||, daughter of Elvis Presley, over the phone. They married in ||La_Vega,_Dominican_Republic||, in May 1994 by civil judge Hugo Francisco Alvarez Perez. The tabloid media speculated that the wedding was a publicity stunt to deflect Jackson's sexual abuse allegations and jump-start Presley's career as a singer. Their marriage ended little more than a year later, and they separated in December 1995. Presley cited "irreconcilable differences" when filing for divorce the next month and only sought to reclaim her maiden name as her settlement. After the divorce, Judge Perez said, "They lasted longer than I thought they would. I gave them a year. They lasted a year and a half." Jackson was set to compose music for the ||Sega_Genesis|| video game ||Sonic_the_Hedgehog_3|| (1994), but left the project around the time the sexual abuse allegations surfaced and went uncredited. Jackson was a Sonic fan, and had collaborated with ||Sega|| for the 1990 arcade game ||Moonwalker_(video_game)||. The reasons for Jackson's departure and whether his compositions remain in the released game have been the subject of debate. ||Sega_Technical_Institute|| director Roger Hector and ||Sonic_the_Hedgehog|| co-creator ||Naoto_Ohshima|| said that Jackson's involvement was terminated and his music reworked following the allegations. However, Jackson's musical director ||Brad_Buxer|| and two other members of Jackson's team, Doug Grigsby III and Ciorocco Jones, said the music remained and that Jackson went uncredited because he was unhappy with how the Genesis replicated his music. HIStory, second marriage, and fatherhood (1995–1997) In June 1995, Jackson released the double album ||HIStory:_Past,_Present_and_Future,_Book_I||. The first disc, HIStory Begins, is a ||Greatest_hits_album|| (reissued in 2001 as Greatest Hits: HIStory, Volume I). The second disc, HIStory Continues, contains 13 original songs and two cover versions. The album debuted at number one on the charts and has been certified for eight million shipments in the US. It is the best-selling multi-disc album of all time, with 20 million copies (40 million units) sold worldwide. HIStory received a Grammy nomination for ||Grammy_Award_for_Album_of_the_Year||. The New York Times reviewed it as "the testimony of a musician whose self-pity now equals his talent". The first single from HIStory was "||Scream_(Michael_Jackson_and_Janet_Jackson_song)||/||Childhood_(Michael_Jackson_song)||". "Scream", a duet with Jackson's youngest sister Janet, protests the media's treatment of Jackson during the 1993 child abuse allegations against him. The single reached number five on the Billboard Hot 100, and received a Grammy nomination for "Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals". The second single, "||You_Are_Not_Alone||", holds the Guinness world record for the first song to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It received a Grammy nomination for "Best Pop Vocal Performance" in 1995. In 1995 the ||Anti-Defamation_League|| and other groups complained that "Jew me, sue me, everybody do me/ Kick me, ||Kike|| me, don't you black or white me", the original lyrics of "||They_Don%27t_Care_About_Us||", were ||Antisemitism_in_the_United_States||. Jackson released a version with revised words. In late 1995, Jackson was admitted to a hospital after collapsing during rehearsals for a televised performance, caused by a stress-related ||Panic_attack||. In November, Jackson merged his ATV Music catalog with Sony's music publishing division, creating ||Sony/ATV_Music_Publishing||. He retained ownership of half the company, earning $95 million up front (equivalent to $161,348,548 in 2020) as well as the ||List_of_Sony/ATV_Music_Publishing_artists||. Jackson at the ||1997_Cannes_Film_Festival|| for the premiere of ||Michael_Jackson%27s_Ghosts|| "||Earth_Song||" was the third single released from HIStory, and topped the ||UK_Singles_Chart|| for six weeks over Christmas 1995. It became the 87th-bestselling single in the UK. At the ||1996_Brit_Awards||, Jackson's performance of "Earth Song" was disrupted by ||Pulp_(band)|| singer ||Jarvis_Cocker||, who was protesting what Cocker saw as Jackson's "Christ-like" persona. Jackson said the stage invasion was "disgusting and cowardly". In 1996, Jackson won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form, for "Scream" and an American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist. Jackson promoted HIStory with the ||HIStory_World_Tour||, from September 7, 1996, to October 15, 1997. He performed 82 concerts in five continents, 35 countries and 58 cities to over 4.5 million fans, his most attended tour. It grossed $165 million. During the tour, in Sydney, Australia, Jackson married ||Debbie_Rowe||, a dermatology assistant, who was six months pregnant with his first child. Michael Joseph Jackson Jr. (commonly known as Prince) was born on February 13, 1997; his sister ||Paris_Jackson_(actress)|| was born a year later on April 3, 1998. Jackson and Rowe divorced in 1999, and Rowe conceded custody of the children, with an $8 million settlement (equivalent to $13,981,822 in 2020). In 2004, after the ||Trial_of_Michael_Jackson||, she returned to court to reclaim custody. The suit was settled in 2006. In 1997, Jackson released ||Blood_on_the_Dance_Floor:_HIStory_in_the_Mix||, which contained remixes of singles from HIStory and five new songs. Worldwide sales stand at 6 million copies, making it the ||List_of_best-selling_remix_albums||. It reached number one in the UK, as did the ||Blood_on_the_Dance_Floor_(song)||. In the US, the album reached number 24 and was certified platinum. Label dispute and Invincible (1997–2002) From October 1997 to September 2001, Jackson worked on his tenth solo album, ||Invincible_(Michael_Jackson_album)||, which cost $30 million to record. In June 1999, Jackson joined ||Luciano_Pavarotti|| for a ||War_Child_(charity)|| benefit concert in Modena, Italy. The show raised a million dollars for refugees of the ||Kosovo_War||, and additional funds for the children of Guatemala. Later that month, Jackson organized a series of "||MJ_%26_Friends||" benefit concerts in Germany and Korea. Other artists involved included ||Slash_(musician)||, ||Scorpions_(band)||, ||Boyz_II_Men||, ||Luther_Vandross||, ||Mariah_Carey||, ||A._R._Rahman||, ||Prabhu_Deva|| Sundaram, ||Shobana||, ||Andrea_Bocelli||, and Luciano Pavarotti. The proceeds went to the ||Nelson_Mandela_Children%27s_Fund||, the ||International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement|| and ||UNESCO||. From August 1999 to 2000, he lived in New York City at 4 ||74th_Street_(Manhattan)||. At the turn of the century, Jackson won an American Music Award as Artist of the 1980s. In 2000, Guinness World Records recognized him for supporting 39 charities, more than any other entertainer. In September 2001, two ||Michael_Jackson:_30th_Anniversary_Special|| were held at Madison Square Garden to mark Jackson's 30th year as a solo artist. Jackson performed with his brothers for the first time since 1984. The show also featured ||M%C3%BDa||, ||Usher_(singer)||, ||Whitney_Houston||, ||Destiny%27s_Child||, ||Monica_(singer)||, ||Liza_Minnelli||, and Slash. The first show was marred by technical lapses, and the crowd booed a speech by ||Marlon_Brando||. Almost 30 million people watched the television broadcast of the shows in November. After the ||September_11_attacks||, Jackson helped organize the ||United_We_Stand:_What_More_Can_I_Give|| benefit concert at ||Robert_F._Kennedy_Memorial_Stadium|| in Washington, D.C. on October 21, 2001. Jackson performed "||What_More_Can_I_Give||" as the finale. The release of Invincible was preceded by a dispute between Jackson and his record label, Sony Music Entertainment. Jackson had expected the licenses to the masters of his albums to revert to him in the early 2000s, after which he would be able to promote the material however he pleased and keep the profits, but clauses in the contract set the revert date years into the future. Jackson sought an early exit from his contract. Invincible was released on October 30, 2001. It was Jackson's first full-length album in six years, and the last album of original material he released in his lifetime. It debuted at number one in 13 countries and went on to sell eight million copies worldwide, receiving double-platinum certification in the US.  Jackson in 2003 On January 9, 2002, Jackson won his 22nd American Music Award for Artist of the Century. Later that year, an anonymous ||Surrogacy|| gave birth to his third child, Prince Michael Jackson II (nicknamed "Blanket"), who had been conceived by ||Artificial_insemination||. On November 20, Jackson briefly held Blanket over the railing of his Berlin hotel room, four stories above ground level, prompting widespread criticism in the media. Jackson apologized for the incident, calling it "a terrible mistake". On January 22, promoter Marcel Avram filed a breach of contract complaint against Jackson for failing to perform two planned 1999 concerts. In March, a Santa Maria jury ordered Jackson to pay Avram $5.3 million. On December 18, 2003, Jackson's attorneys dropped all appeals on the verdict and settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount. On April 24, 2002, Jackson performed at ||Apollo_Theater||. The concert was a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee and former President Bill Clinton. The money collected would be used to encourage citizens to vote. It raised $2.5 million. The concert was called ||Michael_Jackson:_Live_at_the_Apollo_2002|| and this would be Jackson's final on-stage performance. In July 2002, Jackson called Sony Music chairman ||Tommy_Mottola|| "a racist, and very, very, very devilish," and someone who exploits black artists for his own gain, at ||Al_Sharpton|| ||National_Action_Network|| in Harlem. The accusation prompted Sharpton to form a coalition investigating whether Mottola exploited black artists. Jackson charged that Mottola had called his colleague ||Irv_Gotti|| a "fat ||Nigger||". Responding to those attacks, Sony issued a statement calling them "ludicrous, spiteful, and hurtful" and defended Mottola as someone who had championed Jackson's career for many years. Sony ultimately refused to renew Jackson's contract and claimed that a $25 million promotional campaign had failed because Jackson refused to tour in the US for Invincible. Second child sexual abuse allegations, trial, and acquittal (2002–2005) Further information: ||Living_with_Michael_Jackson||, ||Trial_of_Michael_Jackson||, and ||FBI_files_on_Michael_Jackson||  Jackson's ||Mug_shot||, taken on November 20, 2003 Beginning in May 2002, a documentary film crew led by ||Martin_Bashir|| followed Jackson for several months. The documentary, broadcast in February 2003 as ||Living_with_Michael_Jackson||, showed Jackson holding hands and discussing sleeping arrangements with a 12-year-old boy. He said that he saw nothing wrong with having sleepovers with minors and sharing his bed and bedroom with various people, which aroused controversy. He insisted that the sleepovers were not sexual and that his words had been misunderstood. On November 18, 2003, Sony released ||Number_Ones_(Michael_Jackson_album)||, a ||Number_Ones_(Michael_Jackson_album)||. It was certified five-times platinum by the RIAA, and nine times platinum in the UK, for shipments of at least 2.7 million units. On December 18, 2003, Santa Barbara authorities charged Jackson with seven counts of child molestation and two counts of intoxicating a minor with ||Alcoholic_drink||. Jackson denied the allegations and pleaded not guilty. The ||Trial_of_Michael_Jackson|| trial began on January 31, 2005, in ||Santa_Maria,_California||, and lasted until the end of May. Jackson found the experience stressful and it affected his health. If convicted, he would have faced up to 20 years in prison. On June 13, 2005, Jackson was acquitted on all counts. After the trial, he became reclusive and moved to ||Bahrain|| as a guest of ||Abdullah_bin_Hamad_bin_Isa_Al_Khalifa||. In December 2009, The ||Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation|| (FBI) released files on Michael Jackson. These files revealed the Bureau's role in the 2005 trial and the 1993 allegations against Jackson, among other revelations. The FBI found no evidence of criminal conduct on Jackson's behalf. Final years and This Is It (2006–2009)  Jackson and his son Blanket in ||Disneyland_Paris||, 2006 In April 2006, Jackson agreed to use a piece of his ATV catalog stake, then worth about $1 billion, as ||Collateral_(finance)|| against his $270 million worth of loans from ||Bank_of_America||. Bank of America had sold the loans to ||Fortress_Investment_Group||, an investment company that buys distressed loans, the year before. As part of the agreement, Fortress Investments provided Jackson a new loan of $300 million with reduced interest payments (equivalent to $385,127,105 in 2020). Sony Music would have the option to buy half of his stake, or about 25% of the catalog, at a set price. Jackson's financial managers had urged him to shed part of his stake to avoid bankruptcy. The main house at Neverland Ranch was closed as a cost-cutting measure, while Jackson lived in Bahrain at the hospitality of Sheik Abdullah, the ruler's son. At least 30 of Jackson's employees had not been paid on time and were owed $306,000 in back wages; Jackson was ordered to pay $100,000 in penalties. In early 2006, it was announced that Jackson had signed a contract with a Bahrain-based startup, Two Seas Records; nothing came of the deal, and Two Seas CEO ||Gut_Records|| later said it was never finalized. That October, ||Fox_News_Channel|| reported that Jackson had been recording at a studio in ||County_Westmeath||, Ireland. It was not known what Jackson was working on, or who had paid for the sessions; his publicist stated that he had left Two Seas by then. In November 2006, Jackson invited an ||Access_Hollywood|| camera crew into the studio in Westmeath, and ||MSNBC|| reported that he was working on a new album, produced by ||Will.i.am||. On November 15, Jackson briefly performed "We Are the World" at the ||2006_World_Music_Awards|| in London and accepted the Diamond Award honoring the sale of over 100 million records. The event was Jackson's last public performance in his lifetime. He returned to the U.S. in December 2006, settling in ||Las_Vegas||, and attended ||James_Brown||'s funeral in ||Augusta,_Georgia|| later that month, where he gave a eulogy calling Brown his greatest inspiration. In 2007, Jackson and Sony bought another music publishing company, ||Famous_Music|| LLC, formerly owned by ||Viacom_(2005%E2%80%932019)||. The deal gave him the rights to songs by ||Eminem|| and ||Beck||, among others. In a brief interview with the ||Associated_Press|| in Tokyo, Jackson said he had no regrets about his lifelong career despite difficulties and "deliberate attempts to hurt [him]". That March, Jackson visited a US Army post in Japan, ||Camp_Zama||, to greet over 3,000 troops and their families. In September 2007, Jackson was still working on his next album, which he never completed. For the 25th anniversary of Thriller in 2008, Jackson and Sony released ||Thriller_25||, with two remixes released as singles: "||The_Girl_Is_Mine_2008||" and "||Wanna_Be_Startin%27_Somethin%27_2008||". For Jackson's 50th birthday, Sony BMG released a series of greatest hits albums, ||King_of_Pop_(album)||, with different tracklists for different regions.  An aerial view of part of Jackson's 2,800-acre (11 km) Neverland Valley Ranch near Los Olivos, California, showing the rides In 2008, Fortress Investments threatened to ||Foreclosure|| on Neverland Ranch, which Jackson had used as collateral for his loans. Fortress sold Jackson's debts to ||Colony_Capital|| LLC. In November, Jackson transferred Neverland Ranch's title to Sycamore Valley Ranch Company LLC, a joint venture between Jackson and Colony Capital LLC. The deal earned him $35 million. Jackson arranged to sell a collection of his memorabilia of more than 1,000 items through ||Julien%27s_Auctions||. On the eve of the first public exhibit, Jackson canceled the auction after earning between $200 million to $300 million of initial sales from a series of concerts to be held in London. In March 2009, amid speculation about his finances and health, Jackson announced a series of comeback concerts, ||This_Is_It_(concert_residency)||, at a press conference at ||The_O2_Arena||. The shows were to be his first major concerts since the HIStory World Tour in 1997. Jackson suggested he would retire after the shows. The initial plan was for 10 concerts in London, followed by shows in Paris, New York City and Mumbai. Randy Phillips, president and chief executive of ||Anschutz_Entertainment_Group||, predicted the first 10 dates would earn Jackson £50 million. The London residency was increased to 50 dates after record-breaking ticket sales; over one million were sold in less than two hours. The concerts were to run from July 13, 2009, to March 6, 2010. Jackson moved to Los Angeles, where he rehearsed in the weeks leading up to the tour under the direction of choreographer ||Kenny_Ortega||, whom he had worked with during his previous tours. Most rehearsals took place at the ||Staples_Center|| owned by AEG. Death Main article: ||Death_of_Michael_Jackson||  Fans placed flowers and notes on Jackson's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on the day of his death On June 25, 2009, less than three weeks before the first This Is It show was due to begin in London, with all concerts sold out, Jackson died from ||Cardiac_arrest||, caused by a propofol and benzodiazepine overdose. ||Conrad_Murray||, his personal physician, had given Jackson various medications to help him sleep at his rented mansion in ||Holmby_Hills,_Los_Angeles||. Paramedics received a ||9-1-1|| call at 12:22 pm ||Pacific_Time_Zone|| (19:22 UTC), and arrived three minutes later. Jackson was not breathing and ||Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation|| was performed. Resuscitation efforts continued en route to ||Ronald_Reagan_UCLA_Medical_Center||, and for more than an hour after Jackson's arrival there, but were unsuccessful, and Jackson was pronounced dead at 2:26 pm Pacific time (21:26 UTC). Jackson was administered ||Propofol||, ||Lorazepam||, and ||Midazolam||; his death was caused by a propofol overdose. News of his death spread quickly online, causing websites to slow down and ||Crash_(computing)|| from user overload, and putting unprecedented strain on services and websites including ||Google_Search||, ||AOL_Instant_Messenger||, ||Twitter||, and ||Wikipedia||. Overall, ||Web_traffic|| rose by between 11% and 20%. MTV and ||BET|| aired ||Marathon_(media)|| of Jackson's music videos, and Jackson specials aired on television stations around the world. MTV briefly returned to its original music video format, and aired hours of Jackson's music videos, with live news specials featuring reactions from MTV personalities and other celebrities. Memorial service Main article: ||Michael_Jackson_memorial_service||  Jackson's unmarked crypt at the end of the Sanctuary of Ascension in the Holly Terrace of the Great Mausoleum, Forest Lawn Glendale Jackson's memorial was held on July 7, 2009, at the ||Staples_Center|| in Los Angeles, preceded by a private family service at ||Forest_Lawn_Memorial_Park,_Hollywood_Hills#Court_of_Liberty||. Over 1.6 million fans applied for tickets to the memorial; the 8,750 recipients were drawn at random, and each received two tickets. The memorial service was one of the most watched events in ||Streaming_media|| history, with an estimated US audience of 31.1 million and a worldwide audience of an estimated 2.5 to 3 billion. ||Mariah_Carey||, ||Stevie_Wonder||, ||Lionel_Richie||, ||Jennifer_Hudson||, and ||Shaheen_Jafargholi|| performed at the memorial, and ||Smokey_Robinson|| and ||Queen_Latifah|| gave eulogies. ||Al_Sharpton|| received a standing ovation with cheers when he told Jackson's children: "Wasn't nothing strange about your daddy. It was strange what your daddy had to deal with. But he dealt with it anyway." Jackson's 11-year-old daughter ||Paris_Jackson||, speaking publicly for the first time, wept as she addressed the crowd. The Rev. Lucious Smith provided a closing prayer. Jackson's body was entombed on September 3, 2009, at ||Forest_Lawn_Memorial_Park_(Glendale)|| in ||Glendale,_California||. Criminal investigation and prosecution of Conrad Murray Main article: ||California_v._Murray||  Fans visiting the makeshift memorial set up outside the Neverland Ranch entrance shortly after Jackson's death. In August 2009, the ||Los_Angeles_County_Coroner|| ruled that Jackson's death was a ||Homicide||. Law enforcement officials ||California_v._Murray|| with ||Involuntary_manslaughter|| on February 8, 2010. In late 2011, he was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and held without bail to await sentencing. Murray was sentenced to four years in prison. Posthumous sales At the ||American_Music_Awards_of_2009||, Jackson won four posthumous awards, including two for his compilation album ||Number_Ones_(Michael_Jackson_album)||, bringing his total American Music Awards to 26. In the year after his death, more than 16.1 million of Jackson's albums sold in the US and 35 million albums sold worldwide, more than any other artist in 2009. He became the first artist to sell one million ||Music_download|| in a week, with 2.6 million song downloads. ||Thriller_(Michael_Jackson_album)||, Number Ones, and ||The_Essential_Michael_Jackson|| became the first catalog albums to outsell any new album. Jackson also became the first artist to have four of the top 20 best-selling albums in a single year in the US. Following the surge in sales, in March 2010, Sony Music signed a $250 million deal (equivalent to $296,696,170 in 2020) with the Jackson estate to extend their distribution rights to Jackson's back catalog until at least 2017; it had been due to expire in 2015. It was the most expensive music contract for a single artist in history. They agreed to release ten albums of previously unreleased material and new collections of released work. The deal was extended in 2017. That July, a Los Angeles court awarded Jones $9.4 million of disputed royalty payments for Off the Wall, Thriller, and Bad. In July 2018, Sony/ATV bought the estate's stake in EMI for $287.5 million. In 2014, Jackson became the first artist to have a top ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades. The following year, Thriller became the first album to be certified for 30 million shipments by the ||Recording_Industry_Association_of_America||; a year later, it was certified 33× platinum, after ||Soundscan|| added streams and audio downloads to album certifications. Posthumous releases and productions The first posthumous Jackson song, "||This_Is_It_(Michael_Jackson_song)||", co-written in the 1980s with ||Paul_Anka||, was released in October 2009. The surviving Jackson brothers reunited to record backing vocals. It was followed by a documentary film about the rehearsals for the canceled This Is It tour, ||Michael_Jackson%27s_This_Is_It||, and ||Michael_Jackson%27s_This_Is_It_(album)||. Despite a limited two-week engagement, the film became the highest-grossing documentary or concert film ever, with earnings of more than $260 million worldwide. Jackson's estate received 90% of the profits. In late 2010, Sony released the first posthumous album, ||Michael_(album)||, and the promotional single "||Breaking_News_(Michael_Jackson_song)||". Jackson collaborator will.i.am expressed disgust, saying that Jackson would not have approved the release. Video game developer ||Ubisoft|| released a ||Music_video_game|| featuring Jackson for the 2010 holiday season, ||Michael_Jackson:_The_Experience||; it was among the first games to use ||Kinect|| and ||PlayStation_Move||, the motion-detecting camera systems for ||Xbox_360|| and ||PlayStation_3||. ||Xscape_(album)||, an album of unreleased material, was released on May 13, 2014. Later that year, ||Queen_(band)|| released a duet recorded with Jackson and Freddie Mercury in the 1980s. A compilation album, ||Scream_(Michael_Jackson_album)||, was released on September 29, 2017. In October 2011, the theater company ||Cirque_du_Soleil|| launched ||Michael_Jackson:_The_Immortal_World_Tour||, a $57-million production, in Montreal, with a permanent show ||Residency_show|| in Las Vegas. A larger and more theatrical Cirque show, ||Michael_Jackson:_One||, designed for residency at the ||Mandalay_Bay|| resort in Las Vegas, opened on May 23, 2013, in a renovated theater. A ||Jukebox_musical||, ||MJ_the_Musical||, premiered on Broadway in 2022. In April 2011, ||Mohamed_Al-Fayed||, chairman of ||Fulham_F.C.||, unveiled a ||Fulham_statue_of_Michael_Jackson|| outside the club stadium, ||Craven_Cottage||. It was moved to the ||National_Football_Museum|| in Manchester in May 2014, and removed from display in March 2019 following renewed sexual assault allegations. In 2012, in an attempt to end a family dispute, Jackson's brother ||Jermaine_Jackson|| retracted his signature on a public letter criticizing executors of Jackson's estate and his mother's advisors over the legitimacy of his brother's will. T.J. Jackson, son of Tito Jackson, was given co-guardianship of Michael Jackson's children after false reports of Katherine Jackson going missing. A duet between Jackson and ||Justin_Timberlake|| titled "||Love_Never_Felt_So_Good||" was released in 2014, making Jackson the first artist to have a top 10 single on the US Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades when the single reached number 9. In November 2019, it was reported that a Jackson biopic, produced by ||Bohemian_Rhapsody_(film)|| (2018) producer ||Graham_King||, was in the works, with the screenplay written by ||John_Logan_(writer)||. Jackson's estate granted King the rights to his music and will work with King. Posthumous child sexual abuse allegations Further information: ||Leaving_Neverland||, ||Square_One:_Michael_Jackson||, ||Neverland_Firsthand:_Investigating_the_Michael_Jackson_Documentary||, and ||Michael_Jackson:_Chase_the_Truth||  Jackson and Safechuck (right) in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1988 In 2013, choreographer ||Wade_Robson|| filed a lawsuit alleging that Jackson had sexually abused him for seven years, beginning when he was seven years old (1989–1996). In 2014, a case was filed by James Safechuck, alleging sexual abuse over a four-year period from the age of ten (1988–1992). Both had testified in Jackson's defense during the 1993 allegations; Robson did so again in 2005. In 2015, Robson's case against Jackson's estate was dismissed on the grounds of being filed too late. Safechuck's claim was also time-barred. In 2017, it was ruled that Jackson's corporations could not be held accountable for his alleged past actions. The rulings were appealed, and on October 20, 2020, Safechuck's lawsuit against Jackson's corporations was again dismissed, with the presiding judge ruling that there was no evidence that Safechuck had a relationship with Jackson's companies. On April 26, 2021, Robson's case was dismissed because of a lack of supporting evidence that the defendants exercised control over Jackson. Robson and Safechuck described allegations in graphic detail in the documentary Leaving Neverland, released in March 2019. Radio stations in New Zealand, Canada, the UK and the Netherlands removed Jackson's music from their playlists. Jackson's family condemned the film as a "public lynching", and the Jackson estate released a statement calling the film a "tabloid character assassination [Jackson] endured in life, and now in death". Close associates of Jackson, such as ||Corey_Feldman||, ||Aaron_Carter||, Brett Barnes, and ||Macaulay_Culkin||, said that Jackson had not molested them. Rebuttal documentaries, such as Square One: Michael Jackson, Neverland Firsthand: Investigating the Michael Jackson Documentary and Michael Jackson: Chase the Truth, presented information countering the claims. Jackson's album sales increased following the documentary. Billboard senior editor Gail Mitchell said she and a colleague interviewed about thirty music executives who believed Jackson's legacy could withstand the controversy. In late 2019, some New Zealand and Canadian radio stations re-added Jackson's music to their playlists, citing "positive listener survey results". On February 21, 2019, the Jackson estate sued HBO for breaching a non-disparagement clause from a 1992 contract. The suit sought to compel HBO to participate in a non-confidential arbitration that could result in $100 million or more in damages rewarded to the estate. HBO said they did not breach a contract and filed an anti-||Strategic_lawsuit_against_public_participation|| motion against the estate. In September 2019, Judge ||George_H._Wu|| denied HBO's motion to dismiss the case, allowing the Jackson estate to arbitrate. HBO appealed, but in December 2020 the appeal court affirmed Judge Wu's ruling. Legacy See also: ||Cultural_impact_of_Michael_Jackson|| and ||List_of_Michael_Jackson_records_and_achievements|| Michael Jackson graffiti in ||Santa_Cruz,_California|| Jackson has been referred to as the "||Honorific_nicknames_in_popular_music||" for having transformed the art of music videos and paving the way for modern pop music. For much of Jackson's career, he had an unparalleled worldwide influence over the younger generation. His influence extended beyond the music industry; he impacted dance, led fashion trends, and raised awareness for global affairs. Jackson's music and videos fostered racial diversity in MTV's roster and steered its focus from rock to pop music and R&B, shaping the channel into a form that proved enduring. In songs such as "||Man_in_the_Mirror||", "||Black_or_White||", ||Heal_the_World||, "||Earth_Song||" and "||They_Don%27t_Care_About_Us||", Jackson's music emphasized ||Racial_integration|| and ||Environmentalism|| and protested injustice. He is recognized as the Most Successful Entertainer of All Time by ||Guinness_World_Records||. He is considered one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, and his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades.Trying to trace Michael Jackson's influence on the pop stars that followed him is like trying to trace the influence of oxygen and gravity. So vast, far-reaching and was his impact—particularly in the wake of ||Thriller_(album)||'s colossal and heretofore unmatched commercial success—that there weren't a whole lot of artists who weren't trying to mimic some of the Jackson formula.— J. Edward Keyes of ||Rolling_Stone|| Danyel Smith, chief content officer of Vibe Media Group and the editor-in-chief of ||Vibe_(magazine)||, described Jackson as "the Greatest Star". Steve Huey of AllMusic called him "an unstoppable juggernaut, possessed of all the skills to dominate the charts seemingly at will: an instantly identifiable voice, eye-popping dance moves, stunning musical versatility and loads of sheer star power". BET said Jackson was "quite simply the greatest entertainer of all time" whose "sound, style, movement and legacy continues to inspire artists of all genres".  Jackson's Bad era wax figure at ||Madame_Tussauds||, London in 1992 In 1984, ||Time_(magazine)|| pop critic ||Jay_Cocks|| wrote that "Jackson is the biggest thing since the Beatles. He is the hottest single phenomenon since Elvis Presley. He just may be the most popular black singer ever." He described Jackson as a "star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style, and color too." In 2003, ||The_Daily_Telegraph|| writer ||Tom_Utley|| described Jackson as "extremely important" and a "genius". At Jackson's memorial service on July 7, 2009, Motown founder Berry Gordy called Jackson "the greatest entertainer that ever lived". In a June 28, 2009 ||Baltimore_Sun|| article, Jill Rosen wrote that Jackson's legacy influenced fields including sound, dance, fashion, music videos and celebrity. Pop critic ||Robert_Christgau|| wrote that Jackson's work from the 1970s to the early 1990s showed "immense originality, adaptability, and ambition" with "genius beats, hooks, arrangements, and vocals (though not lyrics)", music that "will stand forever as a reproach to the puritanical notion that pop music is slick or shallow and that's the end of it". During the 1990s, as Jackson lost control of his "troubling life", his music suffered and began to shape "an arc not merely of promise fulfilled and outlived, but of something approaching tragedy: a phenomenally ebullient child star tops himself like none before, only to transmute audibly into a lost weirdo". In the 2000s, Christgau wrote: "Jackson's obsession with fame, his grotesque life magnified by his grotesque wealth, are such an offense to rock aesthetes that the fact that he's a great musician is now often forgotten". Artistry Influences  Jackson's Bad era jacket on display at the ||Hollywood,_Los_Angeles|| ||Guinness_World_Records#Museums||.Jackson was influenced by musicians including James Brown, ||Little_Richard||, ||Jackie_Wilson||, Diana Ross, ||Fred_Astaire||, Sammy Davis Jr., ||Gene_Kelly||, and ||David_Ruffin||. Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, but Brown was his greatest inspiration; he later said that as a small child, his mother would wake him whenever Brown appeared on television. Jackson described being "mesmerized". Jackson's vocal technique was influenced by Diana Ross; his use of the oooh interjection from a young age was something Ross had used on many of her songs with ||The_Supremes||. She was a mother figure to him, and he often watched her rehearse. He said he had learned a lot from watching how she moved and sang, and that she had encouraged him to have confidence in himself. Choreographer ||David_Winters_(choreographer)||, who met Jackson while choreographing the 1971 Diana Ross TV special ||Diana!||, said that Jackson watched the musical ||West_Side_Story_(1961_film)|| almost every week, and it was his favorite film; he paid tribute to it in "Beat It" and the "Bad" video. Vocal style Jackson sang from childhood, and over time his voice and vocal style changed. Between 1971 and 1975, his voice descended from boy ||Soprano|| to high ||Tenor||. He was known for his vocal range. With the arrival of Off the Wall in the late 1970s, Jackson's abilities as a vocalist were well regarded; Rolling Stone compared his vocals to the "breathless, dreamy stutter" of Stevie Wonder, and wrote that "Jackson's feathery-timbred tenor is extraordinarily beautiful. It slides smoothly into a startling ||Falsetto|| that's used very daringly." By the time of 1982's Thriller, Rolling Stone wrote that Jackson was singing in a "fully adult voice" that was "tinged by sadness". The turn of the 1990s saw the release of the introspective album Dangerous. The New York Times noted that on some tracks, "he gulps for breath, his voice quivers with anxiety or drops to a desperate whisper, hissing through clenched teeth" and he had a "wretched tone". When singing of brotherhood or self-esteem the musician would return to "smooth" vocals. Of Invincible, Rolling Stone wrote that, at 43, Jackson still performed "exquisitely voiced rhythm tracks and vibrating vocal harmonies". ||Joseph_Vogel|| notes Jackson's ability to use non-verbal sounds to express emotion. ||Neil_McCormick|| wrote that Jackson's unorthodox singing style "was original and utterly distinctive". Musicianship Jackson had no formal music training and could not read or write ||Musical_notation||. He is credited for playing guitar, keyboard, and drums, but was not proficient in them. When composing, he recorded ideas by beatboxing and imitating instruments vocally. Describing the process, he said: "I'll just sing the bass part into the tape recorder. I'll take that bass lick and put the chords of the melody over the bass lick and that's what inspires the melody." Engineer Robert Hoffman recalled that after Jackson came in with a song he had written overnight, Jackson sang every note of every chord to a guitar player. Hoffman also remembered Jackson singing string arrangements part by part into a cassette recorder. Dance Jackson danced from a young age as part of the Jackson 5, and incorporated dance extensively in his performances and music videos. According to Sanjoy Roy of ||The_Guardian||, Jackson would "flick and retract his limbs like switchblades, or snap out of a tornado spin into a perfectly poised toe-stand". The ||Moonwalk_(dance)||, taught to him by ||Jeffrey_Daniel||, was Jackson's signature dance move and one of the most famous of the 20th century. Jackson is credited for coining the name "moonwalk"; the move was previously known as the "backslide". His other moves included the ||Robot_(dance)||, crotch grab, and the "anti-gravity" lean of the "Smooth Criminal" video. Themes and genres  Jackson during his ||Bad_(tour)|| tour in Vienna, June 1988 Jackson explored genres including pop, ||Soul_music||, ||Rhythm_and_blues||, ||Funk||, rock, ||Disco||, ||Post-disco||, ||Dance-pop|| and ||New_jack_swing||. Steve Huey of ||AllMusic|| wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful. Its tracks included the ballads "The Lady in My Life", "||Human_Nature_(Michael_Jackson_song)||", and "||The_Girl_Is_Mine||", the funk pieces "Billie Jean" and "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'", and the disco set "||Baby_Be_Mine_(Michael_Jackson_song)||" and "||P.Y.T._(Pretty_Young_Thing)||". With Off the Wall, Jackson's "vocabulary of grunts, squeals, hiccups, moans, and asides" vividly showed his maturation into an adult, ||Robert_Christgau|| wrote in ||Christgau%27s_Record_Guide:_Rock_Albums_of_the_Seventies|| (1981). The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and ||Stevie_Wonder||'s "oddball" music personas: "Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed." With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of ||Paranoia|| and darker imagery. AllMusic's ||Stephen_Thomas_Erlewine|| noted this on the songs "Billie Jean" and "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'". In "Billie Jean", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child, and in "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'" he argues against gossip and the media. "Beat It" decried gang violence in a homage to ||West_Side_Story||, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey. He observed that "||Thriller_(song)||" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the ||Supernatural||, a topic he revisited in subsequent years. In 1985, Jackson co-wrote the charity anthem "We Are the World"; humanitarian themes later became a recurring theme in his lyrics and public persona.  (0:25) Jackson's song "Thriller", released as a single in 1984; Nelson George wrote that it uses cinematic sound effects, horror film motifs, and vocal trickery to convey a sense of danger.  (0:28) A single from the album Bad, released 1988, "Smooth Criminal" features digital drum sounds, keyboard bass, and other percussion elements; George said it gave the impression of a pulsing heart.  (0:18) The lead single from Dangerous, "Black or White", is a danceable rock song with hard rock elements. Problems playing these files? See . In Bad, Jackson's concept of the predatory lover is seen on the rock song "Dirty Diana". The lead single "I Just Can't Stop Loving You" is a traditional love ballad, and "Man in the Mirror" is a ballad of confession and resolution. "||Smooth_Criminal||" is an evocation of bloody assault, rape and likely murder. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine states that Dangerous presents Jackson as a paradoxical person. The first half of the record is dedicated to new jack swing, including songs like "Jam" and "Remember the Time". It was the first Jackson album in which social ills became a primary theme; "Why You Wanna Trip on Me", for example, protests world hunger, AIDS, homelessness and drugs. Dangerous contains sexually charged songs such as "||In_the_Closet||". The title track continues the theme of the predatory lover and compulsive desire. The second half includes introspective, pop-gospel anthems such as "||Will_You_Be_There||", "Heal the World" and "Keep the Faith". In the ballad "||Gone_Too_Soon||", Jackson gives tribute to Ryan White and the plight of those with AIDS. HIStory creates an atmosphere of paranoia. In the new jack swing-funk rock tracks "Scream" and "Tabloid Junkie", and the R&B ballad "||You_Are_Not_Alone||", Jackson retaliates against the injustice and isolation he feels, and directs his anger at the media. In the introspective ballad "||Stranger_in_Moscow||", Jackson laments his "fall from grace"; "Earth Song", "Childhood", "Little Susie" and "Smile" are operatic pop songs. In "||D.S._(song)||", Jackson attacks lawyer ||Thomas_W._Sneddon_Jr.||, who had prosecuted him in both child sexual abuse cases; he describes Sneddon as a white supremacist who wanted to "get my ass, dead or alive". Invincible includes urban soul tracks such as "||Cry_(Michael_Jackson_song)||" and "The Lost Children", ballads such as "||Speechless_(Michael_Jackson_song)||", "Break of Dawn", and "Butterflies" and mixes hip hop, pop, and R&B in "2000 Watts", "Heartbreaker" and "Invincible". Music videos and choreography  Jackson (center) performing a dance sequence of "||The_Way_You_Make_Me_Feel||" at the Bad tour in 1988. Jackson released "||Michael_Jackson%27s_Thriller_(music_video)||", a 14-minute music video directed by ||John_Landis||, in 1983. The ||Zombie||-themed video "defined music videos and broke racial barriers" on ||MTV||, which had launched two years earlier. Before Thriller, Jackson struggled to receive coverage on MTV, allegedly because he was African American. Pressure from CBS Records persuaded MTV to start showing "Billie Jean" and later "Beat It", which led to a lengthy partnership with Jackson, and helped other black music artists gain recognition. The popularity of his videos on MTV helped the relatively new channel's viewing figures, and MTV's focus shifted toward pop and R&B. His performance on Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever changed the scope of live stage shows, making it acceptable for artists to lip-sync to music video on stage. The choreography in Thriller has been copied in ||Cinema_of_India|| and ||Thriller_(viral_video)||. Thriller marked an increase in scale for music videos, and was named the most successful music video ever by the Guinness World Records. In "Bad"'s 19-minute video—directed by ||Martin_Scorsese||—Jackson used sexual imagery and choreography, and touched his chest, torso and crotch. When asked by Winfrey in the 1993 interview about why he grabbed his crotch, he said it was spontaneously compelled by the music. Time magazine described the "Bad" video as "infamous". It featured ||Wesley_Snipes||; Jackson's later videos often featured famous cameo roles. For the "Smooth Criminal" video, Jackson experimented with leaning forward at a 45 degree angle, beyond the performer's center of gravity. To accomplish this live, Jackson and designers developed a special shoe to lock the performer's feet to the stage, allowing them to lean forward. They were granted for the device. The video for "Leave Me Alone" was not officially released in the US, but in 1989 was nominated for three Billboard Music Video Awards and won a Golden Lion Award for its special effects. It won a Grammy for ||Grammy_Award_for_Best_Music_Video||. He received the ||Michael_Jackson_Video_Vanguard_Award|| in 1988; in 2001 the award was renamed in his honor. The "Black or White" video simultaneously premiered on November 14, 1991, in 27 countries with an estimated audience of 500 million people, the largest audience ever for a music video at the time. Along with Jackson, it featured ||Macaulay_Culkin||, ||Peggy_Lipton||, and ||George_Wendt||. It helped introduce ||Morphing|| to music videos. It was controversial for scenes in which Jackson rubs his crotch, vandalizes cars, and throws a garbage can through a storefront. He apologized and removed the final scene of the video. "In the Closet" featured ||Naomi_Campbell|| in a courtship dance with Jackson. "Remember the Time" was set in ||Ancient_Egypt||, and featured ||Eddie_Murphy||, ||Iman_(model)||, and ||Magic_Johnson||. The video for "Scream", directed by ||Mark_Romanek|| and production designer Tom Foden, gained a record 11 ||MTV_Video_Music_Award|| Nominations, and won "Best Dance Video", "Best Choreography", and "Best Art Direction". The song and its video are Jackson's response to being accused of child molestation in 1993. A year later, it won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form. It has been reported as the ||List_of_most_expensive_music_videos||, at $7 million; Romanek has contradicted this. The "Earth Song" video was nominated for the 1997 Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form. ||Michael_Jackson%27s_Ghosts||, a short film written by Jackson and ||Stephen_King|| and directed by ||Stan_Winston||, premiered at the 1996 ||Cannes_Film_Festival||. At over 38 minutes long, it held the Guinness world record for the longest music video until 2013, when it was eclipsed by the video for the ||Pharrell_Williams|| song "||Happy_(Pharrell_Williams_song)||". The 2001 video for "||You_Rock_My_World||" lasts over 13 minutes, was directed by ||Paul_Hunter_(director)||, and features ||Chris_Tucker|| and ||Marlon_Brando||. It won an ||NAACP_Image_Award|| for Outstanding Music Video in 2002. In December 2009, the ||Library_of_Congress|| selected "Thriller" as the only music video to be preserved in the ||National_Film_Registry||, as a work of "enduring importance to American culture". Huey wrote that Jackson transformed the music video into an artform and a promotional tool through complex story lines, dance routines, special effects and famous cameos, while breaking down racial barriers.

In 1992, he was invested as a ||Title_of_honour|| of ||Kingdom_of_Sanwi||, a traditional ||Monarchy|| located in the south-east of ||Republic_of_Ivory_Coast||. In July 2009, the Lunar Republic Society named a crater on the Moon after Jackson. In August, for what would have been Jackson's 51st birthday, Google dedicated their ||Google_Doodle|| to him. In 2014, the ||British_Council|| of Cultural Relations deemed Jackson's life one of the 80 most important cultural moments of the 20th century. ||World_Vitiligo_Day|| has been celebrated on June 25, the anniversary of Jackson's death, to raise awareness of the auto-immune disorder that Jackson suffered from. Earnings Main article: ||Estate_of_Michael_Jackson|| In 1989, Jackson's annual earnings from album sales, endorsements, and concerts were estimated at $125 million. ||Forbes|| placed Jackson's annual income at $35 million in 1996 and $20 million in 1997. Estimates of Jackson's net worth during his life range from negative $285 million to positive $350 million for 2002, 2003 and 2007. Forbes reported in August 2018 that Jackson's total career pretax earnings in life and death were $4.2 billion. Sales of his recordings through Sony's music unit earned him an estimated $300 million in royalties. He may have earned another $400 million from concerts, music publishing (including his share of the Beatles catalog), endorsements, merchandising and music videos. In 2013, the executors of Jackson's estate filed a petition in the ||United_States_Tax_Court|| as a result of a dispute with the ||Internal_Revenue_Service|| (IRS) over ||Estate_tax_in_the_United_States||. The executors claim that it was worth about $7 million, the IRS that it was worth over $1.1 billion. In February 2014, the IRS reported that Jackson's estate owed $702 million; $505 million in taxes, and $197 million in penalties. A trial was held from February 6 to 24, 2017. In 2021, the Tax Court issued a ruling in favor of the estate, ruling that the estate's total combined value of the estate was $111.5 million and that the value of Jackson's name and likeness was $4 million (not the $61 million estimated by the IRS's outside expert witness). In 2016, Forbes estimated annual gross earnings by the Jackson Estate at $825 million, the largest ever recorded for a celebrity, mostly due to the sale of the Sony/ATV catalog. In 2018, the figure was $400 million. It was the eighth year since his death that Jackson's annual earnings were reported to be over $100 million, thus bringing Jackson's postmortem total to $2.4 billion. In 2020, Forbes recognized Jackson as the ||Forbes%27_list_of_the_world%27s_highest-paid_dead_celebrity|| each year since his death except 2012.

In 2006, ||Raymone_Bain||, Jackson's publicist at that time, claimed that Michael Jackson had sold over 750 million units. Since 2006, several sources such as ||Billboard_(magazine)|| or ||Reuters|| claimed that Michael Jackson had sold around 750 million records; while others such as ||MTV|| or ||CBS_News|| claimed that his sales were over 750 million albums. In 2009, ||The_Wall_Street_Journal|| disputed the 750 million figure (if it referred to albums, instead of units). Later, in 2015, the ||Recording_Industry_Association_of_America|| stated that Michael Jackson has sold 1 billion records worldwide.  In 2018, its US sales record was overtaken by ||Eagles_(band)||' album ||Their_Greatest_Hits_(1971%E2%80%931975)||, with 38× platinum. References Citations  Bain, Raymone K. (October 31, 2006). .

Witnesses do not discuss spiritual matters with a person who has disassociated himself from the Witnesses, including family members. But I want to stress that, contrary to published reports, I was not required to "shun" my son. Our relationship is as loving today as it was when he was a Witness.
