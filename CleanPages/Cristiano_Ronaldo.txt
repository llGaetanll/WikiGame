Often considered the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five ||Ballon_d%27Or|| awards and four ||European_Golden_Shoe||, the most by a European player. He has won ||List_of_career_achievements_by_Cristiano_Ronaldo#Collective_awards||, including seven league titles, five ||UEFA_Champions_League||, one ||UEFA_European_Championship||, and one ||UEFA_Nations_League||. Ronaldo holds the records for ||European_Cup_and_UEFA_Champions_League_records_and_statistics#Players|| (183), ||List_of_UEFA_Champions_League_top_scorers#All-time_top_scorers|| (140), and ||European_Cup_and_UEFA_Champions_League_records_and_statistics#All-time_top_providers|| (42) in the Champions League, ||List_of_UEFA_European_Championship_goalscorers#Overall_top_goalscorers|| (14), ||List_of_men%27s_footballers_with_50_or_more_international_goals|| (115), and ||List_of_men%27s_footballers_with_100_or_more_international_caps|| by a European male (186). He is one of the few players to have made over ||List_of_men%27s_footballers_with_the_most_official_appearances||, and has scored over ||List_of_footballers_with_500_or_more_goals|| for club and country. Born and raised in ||Madeira||, Ronaldo began his senior club career playing for ||Sporting_CP||, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, aged 18, winning the ||FA_Cup|| in his first season. He would also go onto win three consecutive ||Premier_League|| titles, the Champions League and the ||FIFA_Club_World_Cup||; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-||Most_expensive_association_football_transfer|| when he signed for ||Real_Madrid_CF|| in 2009 in a ||Transfer_(association_football)|| worth €94 million (£80 million), where he won 15 trophies, including two ||La_Liga|| titles, two ||Copa_del_Rey||, and four Champions Leagues, and became ||List_of_Real_Madrid_CF_records_and_statistics#Goalscorers||. He won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in ||2013_FIFA_Ballon_d%27Or|| and ||2014_FIFA_Ballon_d%27Or||, and again in ||2016_Ballon_d%27Or|| and ||2017_Ballon_d%27Or||, and was runner-up three times behind ||Lionel_Messi||, his perceived ||Messi%E2%80%93Ronaldo_rivalry||. In 2018, he signed for ||Juventus_F.C.|| in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and the most expensive transfer for a player over 30 years old. He won two ||Serie_A|| titles, two ||Supercoppa_Italiana||, and a ||Coppa_Italia||, before returning to Manchester United in 2021. Ronaldo made his senior international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned over ||List_of_men%27s_footballers_with_100_or_more_international_caps||, making him Portugal's ||Portugal_national_football_team#Most_capped_players||. With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also the nation's ||Portugal_national_football_team#Top_goalscorers||. He has played in and scored at 11 major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at ||UEFA_Euro_2004||, where he helped Portugal reach the ||UEFA_Euro_2004_Final||. He assumed ||List_of_Portugal_national_football_team_captains|| of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the ||Portuguese_Football_Federation||. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at ||UEFA_Euro_2016||, and received the ||UEFA_Euro_2016#Awards|| as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. He also led them to victory in the inaugural ||2018%E2%80%9319_UEFA_Nations_League|| in 2019, and later received the ||UEFA_Euro_2020#Awards|| as top scorer of ||UEFA_Euro_2020||. One of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the ||Forbes%27_list_of_the_world%27s_highest-paid_athletes|| by ||Forbes|| in 2016 and 2017 and the world's most famous athlete by ||ESPN|| from 2016 to 2019. ||Time_(magazine)|| included him on their list of the ||Time_100|| in 2014. He is the first footballer and the third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career. Contents Early life Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born in the ||S%C3%A3o_Pedro_(Funchal)|| parish of ||Funchal||, the capital of the Portuguese island of ||Madeira||, and grew up in the nearby parish of ||Santo_Ant%C3%B3nio_(Funchal)||. He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, a cook, and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener and part-time ||Equipment_manager||. His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, was from the island of ||S%C3%A3o_Vicente,_Cape_Verde||. He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and ||K%C3%A1tia_Aveiro||. His mother revealed that she wanted to ||Abortion|| him due to poverty, his father's ||Alcoholism|| and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure. Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished ||Catholic_Church_in_Portugal|| home, sharing a room with all his siblings. As a child, Ronaldo played for ||CF_Andorinha|| from 1992 to 1995, where his father was the kit man, and later spent two years with ||C.D._Nacional||. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with ||Sporting_CP||, who signed him for a fee of £1,500. He subsequently moved from Madeira to ||Alcochete||, near ||Lisbon||, to join ||Sporting_CP_Youth_Academy||. By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother to cease his education to focus entirely on football. While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had "disrespected" him. One year later, he was diagnosed with ||Tachycardia||, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football. Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to ||Cauterise|| multiple ||Electrical_conduction_system_of_the_heart|| into one, altering his resting ||Heart_rate||. He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later. Club career Sporting CP  Ronaldo memorabilia at Sporting CP's museum At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager ||L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_B%C3%B6l%C3%B6ni||, who was impressed with his dribbling. He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season. A year later, on 29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the ||Primeira_Liga||, against ||S.C._Braga|| and on 7 October, he scored two goals against ||Moreirense_F.C.|| in their 3–0 win. Over the course of the ||2002%E2%80%9303_Primeira_Liga||, his representatives suggested the player to ||Liverpool_F.C.|| manager ||G%C3%A9rard_Houllier|| and ||FC_Barcelona|| president ||Joan_Laporta||. Manager ||Ars%C3%A8ne_Wenger||, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at ||Arsenal_F.C.||'s grounds in November to discuss a possible transfer. ||Manchester_United_F.C.|| manager ||Alex_Ferguson|| was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of the ||Est%C3%A1dio_Jos%C3%A9_Alvalade|| in August 2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year. Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting £12.24 million for what he considered to be "one of the most exciting young players" he had ever seen. A decade after his departure from the club, in April 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member. Manchester United 2003–2007: Development and breakthrough "There have been a few players described as 'the new George Best' over the years, but this is the first time it's been a compliment to me." —Former Manchester United player ||George_Best|| hails the 18-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo in 2003. Ronaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the ||2003_FA_Community_Shield|| but in time for their game against ||Bolton_Wanderers_F.C.|| on the opening day of the ||2003%E2%80%9304_FA_Premier_League||, and made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club. His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history. Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the ||Squad_number_(association_football)|| 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as ||George_Best||, ||Eric_Cantona|| and ||David_Beckham||. Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo. A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career."  Ronaldo playing for Manchester United against ||Chelsea_F.C.|| in the ||2005%E2%80%9306_FA_Premier_League|| season Ronaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4–0 home win over ||Bolton_Wanderers_F.C.|| in the Premier League on 16 August 2003, and received a standing ovation when he came on for ||Nicky_Butt||. His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as "undoubtedly the most exciting debut" he had ever seen. Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3–0 win over ||Portsmouth_F.C.|| on 1 November. Three more league goals followed in the second half of the campaign, the last of which came against ||Aston_Villa_F.C.|| on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received the first ||Red_card_(association_football)|| of his career. Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United's 3–0 win over ||Millwall_F.C.|| in the ||2004_FA_Cup_Final||, earning his first trophy. BBC pundit ||Alan_Hansen|| described him as the star of the final. The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his "elaborate" step-overs in trying to beat opponents, but teammate ||Gary_Neville|| said he was "not a show pony, but the real thing", and predicted he would become a world-class player. "He has got the tricks and party pieces, we know that, but they're not much good unless there is something at the end of it all. We still have to remember, of course, that the lad is only 19 years of age. Considering that, you have to say he has got massive talent. His feet are mesmerising at times, and if he can couple that with some consistently good crossing, the future looks frightening." —Former ||BBC|| pundit ||Alan_Hansen|| commenting on Ronaldo after his first season. Ronaldo scored United's 1,000th Premier League goal on 29 October 2004, their only goal in a 4–1 loss to ||Middlesbrough_F.C.||. A few weeks later, he signed a new contract with the club that extended his previous deal by two years to 2010. At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the ||2004%E2%80%9305_FA_Premier_League||, producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against ||Arsenal_F.C.%E2%80%93Manchester_United_F.C._rivalry|| Arsenal. He played the full 120 minutes of the ||2005_FA_Cup_Final|| against Arsenal, which ended in a goalless draw; although Ronaldo scored his attempt in the ||Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)||, United lost 5–4. Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, the ||2005%E2%80%9306_Football_League_Cup||, after scoring the third goal in United's 4–0 final win over ||Wigan_Athletic_F.C.||. During his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. He had a one-match ban imposed on him by ||UEFA|| for a "||The_finger||" towards ||S.L._Benfica|| fans, and was sent off in the ||Manchester_derby|| (a 3–1 defeat) for kicking ||Manchester_City_F.C.||'s former United player ||Andy_Cole||. Ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker ||Ruud_van_Nistelrooy||, who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play. Following the ||2006_FIFA_World_Cup||, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate ||Wayne_Rooney|| was sent off, Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident. United denied the possibility of him leaving the club. Although his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the ||2006%E2%80%9307_FA_Premier_League||, it proved to be his breakout year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first ||List_of_English_football_champions||. An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first-team coach ||Ren%C3%A9_Meulensteen||, who taught him to make himself more unpredictable, improve his teamwork, call for the ball and capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known. He scored three consecutive braces at the end of December, against Aston Villa (a win that put United on top of the league), Wigan and ||Reading_F.C.||. Ronaldo was named the ||Premier_League_Player_of_the_Month|| in November and December, becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours. 2007–2008: Collective and individual success  Ronaldo playing during the ||2006%E2%80%9307_FA_Premier_League|| season At the quarter-final stage of the ||2006%E2%80%9307_UEFA_Champions_League||, Ronaldo scored his first goals in his 30th match in the competition, scoring twice in a 7–1 win over ||A.S._Roma||. He subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against ||A.C._Milan||, which ended in a 3–2 win, but was ||Marking_(association_football)|| out of the second leg as United lost 3–0 at the ||San_Siro||. He also helped United reach the ||2007_FA_Cup_Final||, but the final against ||Chelsea_F.C.|| ended in a 1–0 defeat. Ronaldo scored the only goal in the Manchester derby on 5 May (his 50th goal for the club), as United won their first league title in four years. As a result of his performances, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season. He won the ||Professional_Footballers%27_Association||'s ||PFA_Players%27_Player_of_the_Year||, ||PFA_Fans%27_Player_of_the_Year|| and ||PFA_Young_Player_of_the_Year|| awards, as well as the ||Football_Writers%27_Association||'s ||FWA_Footballer_of_the_Year|| award, becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours. His wages were concurrently upgraded to £120,000 a week as part of a five-year contract extension. Ronaldo was named runner-up to ||Kak%C3%A1|| for the ||2007_Ballon_d%27Or||, and came third, behind Kaká and ||Lionel_Messi||, in the running for the ||2007_FIFA_World_Player_of_the_Year|| award. Ronaldo scored his first and only ||Hat-trick_(association_football)|| for United in a 6–0 win against ||Newcastle_United_F.C.|| on 12 January 2008, which put United top of the league table. On 19 March, he captained United for the first time in a home win over Bolton and scored both goals in a 2–0 win. His second goal was his 33rd of the campaign, which bettered George Best's total of 32 goals in the 1967–68 season, thus setting the club's new single-season record by a midfielder. His 31 league goals earned him the ||Premier_League_Golden_Boot||, as well as the ||European_Golden_Shoe||, which made him the first winger to win the latter award. He additionally received the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season. In the knockout stage of the Champions League, Ronaldo scored the decisive goal against ||Olympique_Lyonnais||, which helped United advance to the quarter-finals 2–1 on aggregate; while playing as a striker, he scored with a header in the 3–0 aggregate win over Roma. United reached the ||2008_UEFA_Champions_League_Final|| against Chelsea in Moscow, where, despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser and his ||Penalty_kick_(association_football)|| being saved in the shoot-out, United emerged victorious. As the ||List_of_European_Cup_and_UEFA_Champions_League_top_scorers||, Ronaldo was named the ||UEFA_Club_Footballer_of_the_Year||. Ronaldo scored a total of 42 goals in all competitions during the ||2007%E2%80%9308_FA_Premier_League||, his most prolific campaign during his time in England. He missed three matches after headbutting a ||Portsmouth_F.C.|| player at the start of the season, an experience he said taught him not to let opponents provoke him. As rumours circulated of Ronaldo's interest in moving to ||Real_Madrid_CF||, United filed a tampering complaint with governing body FIFA over Madrid's alleged pursuit of their player, but they declined to take action. FIFA president ||Sepp_Blatter|| asserted that the player should be allowed to leave his club, describing the situation as "modern slavery". Despite Ronaldo publicly agreeing with Blatter, he remained at United for another year. 2008–2009: Final season and continued success  Ronaldo in his final season with Manchester United playing in a Premier League game against ||Liverpool_F.C.|| Ahead of the ||2008%E2%80%9309_FA_Premier_League||, on 7 July, Ronaldo underwent ankle surgery, which kept him out of action for 10 weeks. Following his return, he scored his 100th goal in all competitions for United with the first of two ||Free_kick|| in a 5–0 win against ||Stoke_City_F.C.|| on 15 November, which meant he had now scored against all 19 opposition teams in the Premier League at the time. At the close of 2008, Ronaldo helped United win the ||2008_FIFA_Club_World_Cup|| in Japan, assisting the ||2008_FIFA_Club_World_Cup_Final||-winning goal against ||LDU_Quito|| and winning the ||List_of_FIFA_Club_World_Cup_awards#Golden_Ball|| in the process. With his ||2008_Ballon_d%27Or|| and ||2008_FIFA_World_Player_of_the_Year||, Ronaldo became United's first ||Ballon_d%27Or|| winner since Best in 1968, and the first Premier League player to be named the ||FIFA_World_Player_of_the_Year||. His match-winning goal in the second leg against ||FC_Porto||, a 40-yard strike, earned him the inaugural ||FIFA_Pusk%C3%A1s_Award||, presented by FIFA in recognition of the best goal of the year; he later called it the best goal he had ever scored. United advanced to the ||2009_UEFA_Champions_League_Final|| in Rome, where he made little impact in United's 2–0 defeat to Barcelona. Ronaldo ended his time in England with nine trophies, as United claimed their third successive league title and a ||2008%E2%80%9309_Football_League_Cup||. He finished the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions, 16 goals fewer than the previous season, in four more appearances. His final goal for United came on 10 May 2009 with a free kick in the Manchester derby at ||Old_Trafford||. Real Madrid  As his usual number 7 was unavailable, Ronaldo wore number 9 during his ||2009%E2%80%9310_La_Liga|| at Madrid. After ||Ra%C3%BAl_(footballer)|| departed the club, Ronaldo was handed the number 7 shirt before the ||2010%E2%80%9311_La_Liga||. Ahead of the ||2009%E2%80%9310_La_Liga||, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a ||World_football_transfer_record|| at the time, of £80 million (€94 million). His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11 million per year and contained a €1 billion buy-out clause. At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the ||Santiago_Bernab%C3%A9u_Stadium||, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed ||Diego_Maradona|| at ||S.S.C._Napoli||. Since club captain ||Ra%C3%BAl_(footballer)|| already wore the number 7 (the number Ronaldo wore at United), Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt, which was presented to him by former Madrid player ||Alfredo_Di_St%C3%A9fano||. 2009–2013: World record transfer and La Liga championship Ronaldo made his ||La_Liga|| debut against ||Deportivo_de_La_Coru%C3%B1a|| on 29 August and scored from the penalty spot in Madrid's 3–2 home win. He scored in each of his first four league games, the first Madrid player to do so. His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against ||FC_Z%C3%BCrich||. His strong start to the season was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks. A week after his return, he received his first red card in Spain in a match against ||UD_Almer%C3%ADa||. Midway through the season, Ronaldo finished second in the ||2009_Ballon_d%27Or|| and the ||2009_FIFA_World_Player_of_the_Year|| awards, behind Messi of ||FC_Barcelona||, Madrid's rivals. He finished the season with 33 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick in a 4–1 win against ||RCD_Mallorca|| on 5 May 2010, his first in La Liga. His first season at Madrid ended trophyless. Following Raúl's departure, Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt for Madrid before the ||2010%E2%80%9311_La_Liga||. His subsequent return to his Ballon d'Or-winning form was epitomised when, for the first time in his career, he scored four goals in a single match during a 6–1 rout against ||Racing_de_Santander|| on 23 October. His haul concluded a run of scoring in six consecutive matches for club and country, totalling 11 goals, the most he had scored in a single month. Ronaldo subsequently scored further hat-tricks against ||Athletic_Bilbao||, ||Levante_UD||, ||Villarreal_CF|| and ||M%C3%A1laga_CF||. Despite his performances, he did not make the top three in the inaugural ||2010_FIFA_Ballon_d%27Or||. During a historic series of four ||El_Cl%C3%A1sico|| against rivals Barcelona in April 2011, Ronaldo scored twice to equal his personal record of 42 goals in all competitions. Though he failed to score in either leg of the Champions League semi-finals as Madrid were eliminated, he equalised from the penalty spot in the return league game and scored the match-winning goal in the 103rd minute of the ||2011_Copa_del_Rey_Final||, winning his first trophy in Spain. His two goals in the last match of the season against ||UD_Almer%C3%ADa|| made him the first player in La Liga to score 40 goals. In addition to the ||Pichichi_Trophy||, Ronaldo won the European Golden Shoe for a second time, becoming the first player to win the award in different leagues.  Ronaldo scored 46 league goals during the La Liga championship success in his third season in Spain. During the following season, Ronaldo achieved a new personal best of 60 goals in all competitions. He finished as runner-up to Messi for the ||2011_FIFA_Ballon_d%27Or||, after scoring hat-tricks against ||Real_Zaragoza||, ||Rayo_Vallecano||, Málaga, ||CA_Osasuna|| and Sevilla, the last of which put Madrid on top of the league by the season's midway point. Ronaldo found greater team success in the league, helping Madrid win their first ||List_of_Spanish_football_champions|| in four years with a record 100 points. Following a hat-trick against Levante as Madrid further increased their lead over Barcelona, he scored his 100th league goal for Madrid in a 5–1 win over ||Real_Sociedad|| on 24 March 2012, a milestone he reached in just 92 matches across three seasons, breaking the previous club record held by ||Ferenc_Pusk%C3%A1s||. Another hat-trick in the ||Madrid_derby|| against ||Atl%C3%A9tico_Madrid|| brought his total to 40 league goals, equalling his record of the previous season. His final league goal of the season, against Mallorca, took his total to 46 goals, four short of the new record set by Messi, though he became the first player to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single La Liga season. Ronaldo began the ||2012%E2%80%9313_La_Liga|| by lifting the ||2012_Supercopa_de_Espa%C3%B1a||, his third trophy in Spain. With a goal in each leg, he helped Madrid win the Spanish Super Cup on away goals following a 4–4 aggregate draw against Barcelona. Although Ronaldo publicly commented that he was unhappy with a "professional issue" within the club, prompted by his refusal to celebrate his 150th goal for Madrid, his goalscoring rate did not suffer.

As the competition's top goalscorer for the third time, with a record 17 goals, he was named the ||UEFA_Best_Player_in_Europe||. In the Copa del Rey, Ronaldo helped Madrid reach the ||2014_Copa_del_Rey_Final|| by scoring two penalties against Atlético at the ||Vicente_Calder%C3%B3n_Stadium||, the first of which meant he had now scored in every single minute of a 90-minute football match.

In Portugal's ||Battle_of_Nuremberg_(2006_FIFA_World_Cup)|| round of 16 match against the Netherlands, Ronaldo was forced off injured in the first half after a tackle from Dutch defender ||Khalid_Boulahrouz||. Following Portugal's 1–0 win, Ronaldo accused Boulahrouz of intentionally trying to injure him, although he recovered in time to play in the next game. In Portugal's quarter-final against England, Ronaldo's Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off for stamping on Portugal defender ||Ricardo_Carvalho||. Although the referee later clarified that the red card was only due to Rooney's infraction, the English media speculated that Ronaldo had influenced his decision by aggressively complaining, after which he was seen in replays winking at Portugal's bench following Rooney's dismissal. Ronaldo went on to score the vital winning penalty during the shoot-out which sent Portugal into the semi-finals. Ronaldo was subsequently booed during their 1–0 semi-final defeat to ||France_national_football_team||. FIFA's Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament's Best Young Player award and handed it to ||Germany_national_football_team||'s ||Lukas_Podolski||, citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision. Following the 2006 World Cup, Ronaldo would go on to represent Portugal in four qualifying games for ||Euro_2008||, scoring two goals in the process. 2007–2012: Assuming the captaincy  Ronaldo, pictured playing against ||Germany_national_football_team|| at ||Euro_2012||, was made captain for Portugal in 2008. One day after his 22nd birthday, Ronaldo ||List_of_Portugal_national_football_team_captains|| Portugal for the first time in a friendly game against ||Brazil_national_football_team|| on 6 February 2007, as requested by ||Portuguese_Football_Federation|| (FPF) president Carlos Silva, who had died two days earlier. Ahead of Euro 2008, he was given the number 7 shirt for the first time. While he scored eight goals in the ||UEFA_Euro_2008_qualification||, the second-highest tally, he scored just one goal in the tournament, netting the second goal of their 3–1 win in the group stage match against the ||Czech_Republic_national_football_team||; in the same game, he also set-up Portugal's third goal in injury time, which was scored by Quaresma, and was named man of the match for his performance. Portugal were eliminated in the quarter-finals with a 3–2 loss against eventual finalists Germany. After Portugal's unsuccessful performance at Euro 2008, ||Luiz_Felipe_Scolari|| was replaced as coach by Carlos Queiroz, formerly the assistant manager at United. Queiroz made Ronaldo the squad's permanent captain in July 2008. Ronaldo failed to score a single goal in the ||2010_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_(UEFA)|| for the ||2010_World_Cup||, as Portugal narrowly avoided a premature elimination from the tournament with a play-off victory over ||Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_national_football_team||. In the group stage of the World Cup, he was named man of the match in all three matches, against ||Ivory_Coast_national_football_team||, ||North_Korea_national_football_team|| and Brazil. His only goal of the tournament came in their 7–0 rout of North Korea, which marked his first international goal in 16 months. Portugal's World Cup ended with a 1–0 loss against eventual champions ||Spain_national_football_team|| in the round of 16. Ronaldo scored seven goals in the ||UEFA_Euro_2012_qualifying|| for ||Euro_2012||, including two strikes against Bosnia and Herzegovina in the play-offs, to send Portugal into the tournament, where they were drawn in a "||Group_of_death||". In the last group stage game against the Netherlands, Ronaldo scored twice to secure a 2–1 win. He scored a header in the quarter-final against the Czech Republic to give his team a 1–0 win. In both games against the Netherlands and the Czech Republic he was named man of the match. After the semi-finals against Spain ended scoreless, with Ronaldo having sent three shots over the bar, Portugal were eliminated in the penalty shoot-out. Ronaldo did not take a penalty as he had been slated to take the unused fifth slot, a decision that was questioned by the media. Ronaldo's own teammate, ||Nani_(footballer)||, said that Ronaldo "demanded" to take the last penalty. As the joint top scorer with three goals, alongside five other players, he was again included in the team of the tournament. 2012–2016: All-time Portugal top scorer and European champion  Ronaldo evading ||Luka_Modri%C4%87|| during a friendly match against ||Croatia_national_football_team|| in 2013 During the ||2014_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_(UEFA)|| for the ||2014_World_Cup||, Ronaldo scored a total of eight goals. A qualifying match on 17 October 2012, a 1–1 draw against ||Northern_Ireland_national_football_team||, earned him his ||List_of_men%27s_footballers_with_100_or_more_international_caps||. His first international hat-trick also came against Northern Ireland, when he scored three times in a 15-minute spell of a 4–2 qualifying win on 6 September 2013. After Portugal failed to qualify during the regular campaign, Ronaldo scored all four of the team's goals in the play-offs against ||Sweden_national_football_team||, billed as a battle between Ronaldo and ||Zlatan_Ibrahimovi%C4%87||, which ensured their place at the tournament. His hat-trick in the second leg took his international tally to 47 goals, equaling ||Pauleta||'s record. Ronaldo subsequently scored twice in a 5–1 friendly win over ||Cameroon_national_football_team|| on 5 March 2014 to become his country's ||Portugal_national_football_team#Top_goalscorers||. Ronaldo took part in the tournament despite suffering from patellar tendinitis and a related thigh injury, potentially risking his career. Ronaldo later commented: "If we had two or three Cristiano Ronaldos in the team I would feel more comfortable. But we don't." Despite ongoing doubts over his fitness, being forced to abort practice twice, Ronaldo played the full 90 minutes of the opening match against Germany, although he was unable to prevent a 4–0 defeat. After assisting an injury-time 2–2 equaliser against the ||United_States_men%27s_national_soccer_team||, he scored a late match-winning goal in a 2–1 win over ||Ghana_national_football_team||. His ||List_of_men%27s_footballers_with_50_or_more_international_goals|| made him the first Portuguese to play and score in three World Cups. Portugal were eliminated from the tournament at the close of the group stage on goal difference.  Ronaldo leaps in the air in Portugal's ||Euro_2016|| quarter-final match against ||Poland_national_football_team|| Ronaldo scored five goals, including a hat-trick against ||Armenia_national_football_team||, in the ||UEFA_Euro_2016_qualifying|| for ||Euro_2016||. With the only goal in another win over Armenia on 14 November 2014, he reached 23 goals in the ||UEFA_European_Championship||, including qualifying matches, to become the competition's ||List_of_UEFA_European_Championship_records#Goalscoring||. At the start of the tournament, Ronaldo failed to convert his chances in Portugal's draws against ||Iceland_national_football_team|| and ||Austria_national_football_team||, despite taking 20 shots on goal. In the latter match, he overtook Figo as ||Portugal_national_football_team#Most_appearances|| with his 128th international appearance, which ended scoreless after he missed a penalty in the second half. With two goals in the last match of the group stage, a 3–3 draw against ||Hungary_national_football_team||, Ronaldo became the first player to score in four European Championships, having made a ||List_of_UEFA_European_Championship_records#Individual|| in the tournament. Although placed third in their group behind Hungary and Iceland, his team qualified for the knockout round as a result of the competition's newly expanded format, despite not winning any of their games. In Portugal's first knockout match, Ronaldo's only attempt on goal was parried by ||Croatia_national_football_team||'s goalkeeper ||Danijel_Suba%C5%A1i%C4%87|| into the path of ||Ricardo_Quaresma||, whose finish then secured a 1–0 win late in extra time. After his team progressed past ||Poland_national_football_team|| on penalties, with Ronaldo scoring Portugal's opening penalty, he became the first player to participate in three European Championship semi-finals; he scored the opener in a 2–0 win against ||Wales_national_football_team||, equalling ||Michel_Platini|| as the competition's all-time top scorer with nine goals. In the ||UEFA_Euro_2016_Final|| against hosts France, Ronaldo was forced off after just 25 minutes following a challenge from ||Dimitri_Payet||, despite multiple treatments and attempts to play on, he was stretchered off the pitch and replaced by Quaresma. During extra time, substitute ||Eder_(Portuguese_footballer)|| scored in the 109th minute to earn Portugal a 1–0 victory. As team captain, Ronaldo lifted the trophy in celebration of his country's first triumph in a major tournament. He was awarded the ||UEFA_Euro_2016#Awards|| as the joint second-highest goalscorer, with three goals and three assists, and was named to the team of the tournament for the third time in his career. 2016–2018: Post-European Championship victory and World Cup Following the Euro 2016 success, Ronaldo played his first professional match on his home island of Madeira on 28 March 2017 at age 32, opening a 2–3 friendly defeat to Sweden at the ||Est%C3%A1dio_dos_Barreiros||. With the goal, he tied with ||Miroslav_Klose|| on 71 goals as the third-highest scoring European in international football. In Portugal's opening match of the ||2017_FIFA_Confederations_Cup|| against ||Mexico_national_football_team|| on 17 June, Ronaldo set up Quaresma's opening goal in a 2–2 draw. Three days later, he scored in a 1–0 win over hosts ||Russia_national_football_team||. On 24 June, he scored from a penalty in a 4–0 win over ||New_Zealand_national_football_team||, which saw Portugal top their group and advance to the semi-finals of the competition; with his 75th international goal, Ronaldo also equalled ||S%C3%A1ndor_Kocsis|| as the second-highest European international goalscorer of all-time, behind only ||Ferenc_Pusk%C3%A1s||. He was named man of the match in all three of Portugal's group stage matches. Ronaldo left the competition early; after ||Chile_national_football_team|| defeated Portugal 3–0 on penalties in the ||2017_FIFA_Confederations_Cup#Semi-finals||, he was allowed to return home to be with his newborn children, and missed Portugal's ||2017_FIFA_Confederations_Cup#Third_place_play-off|| match in which Portugal defeated Mexico 2–1 after extra time.  Ronaldo evades an ||Iran_national_football_team|| defender in the group stage of the ||2018_World_Cup|| On 31 August 2017, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5–1 win in a ||2018_World_Cup_qualifying|| match over the ||Faroe_Islands_national_football_team||, which saw him overtake Pelé and equal ||Hussein_Saeed|| as the joint-fifth-highest goalscorer in international football with 78 goals. These goals brought his tally in the World Cup qualifiers to 14, equalling ||Predrag_Mijatovi%C4%87||'s record for most goals in a single UEFA qualifying campaign, and also saw him break the record for the most goals scored in a European qualifying group, overtaking the previous record of 13 goals set by ||David_Healy_(footballer)|| and ||Robert_Lewandowski||. Ronaldo's hat-trick took his World Cup qualifying goals total to 29, making him the highest scorer in UEFA qualifiers, ahead of ||Andriy_Shevchenko||, and the highest goalscorer in World Cup qualifying and finals matches combined with 32 goals, ahead of Miroslav Klose. Ronaldo later added to this tally by scoring a goal against Andorra in a 2–0 win. On 15 June 2018, Ronaldo became the oldest player to score a ||List_of_FIFA_World_Cup_hat-tricks|| in a ||FIFA_World_Cup|| match, helping Portugal secure a 3–3 draw against Spain (his third goal a 30-yard curling free kick with two minutes remaining) in their opening match. In doing so, he became the first Portuguese player to score a goal in four World Cups and one of four players of any nationality to do so. On 20 June, Ronaldo scored the only goal in a 1–0 win against ||Morocco_national_football_team||, breaking Puskás' record as the highest European goalscorer of all-time, with 85 international goals. In the final group match against ||Iran_national_football_team|| on 25 June, Ronaldo missed a penalty in an eventual 1–1 draw which saw Portugal progress to the second round as group runners-up behind Spain. On 30 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 2–1 defeat to ||Uruguay_national_football_team|| in the last 16. For his performances in the tournament, Ronaldo was named in the ||2018_FIFA_World_Cup#Dream_Team||. 2018–2020: Nations League title and 100 international goals After the World Cup, Ronaldo missed six international matches, including the entire league phase of the ||2018%E2%80%9319_UEFA_Nations_League||, but played for hosts Portugal in ||2019_UEFA_Nations_League_Finals|| in June 2019. In the semi-finals on 5 June, he scored a hat-trick against ||Switzerland_national_football_team|| to reach ||2019_UEFA_Nations_League_Final||. Upon scoring the opening goal, he became the first player to score in 10 consecutive international competitions, breaking the record he previously shared with Ghana's ||Asamoah_Gyan||. In the final of the tournament four days later, Portugal defeated the Netherlands 1–0. On 10 September 2019, Ronaldo scored four goals in a 5–1 away win over ||Lithuania_national_football_team|| in a ||Euro_2020_qualifying|| match; in the process, he overtook ||Robbie_Keane|| (23 goals) as the player with most goals in the ||UEFA_European_Championship_qualifying||, setting a new record with 25 goals. He also set a new record for scoring against the most national teams, 40, while also completing his eighth international hat-trick. On 14 October, he scored his 700th senior career goal for club and country from the penalty spot, in his 974th senior career appearance, a 2–1 away loss to ||Ukraine_national_football_team|| in a Euro 2020 qualifier. On 17 November, Ronaldo scored his 99th international goal in a 2–0 win over Luxembourg, leading Portugal to qualify for ||Euro_2020||. On 8 September 2020, Ronaldo scored his 100th and 101st international goals in a 2–0 away win over Sweden in a ||2020%E2%80%9321_UEFA_Nations_League|| match, becoming only the second male player ever to achieve this milestone (after ||Ali_Daei|| of Iran) and the first in Europe. On 13 October, the FPF announced that Ronaldo tested positive for ||COVID-19|| while being ||Asymptomatic_carrier||. By 30 October, Ronaldo had recovered. 2021–present: All-time international top goalscorer  The ||Est%C3%A1dio_Algarve|| (exterior pictured) where Ronaldo broke the international goalscoring record (surpassing the 109 goals of Iran's ||Ali_Daei||) in September 2021 On 15 June 2021, Ronaldo scored twice in Portugal's first game of Euro 2020, a 3–0 win against Hungary in ||Budapest||. This took him to a total of eleven European Championship goals, two clear of ||Michel_Platini||, as the ||List_of_UEFA_European_Championship_goalscorers#Overall_top_goalscorers||. He also became the first player to score at five European Championships, and in eleven consecutive tournaments. The brace made Ronaldo the oldest player to score two goals in a match in the European Championship, and the oldest player to score for Portugal at a major tournament. On 23 June, he scored two penalties in Portugal's 2–2 draw with France in their final group stage match, equalling Daei's record of 109 international goals. On 27 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 1–0 loss against ||Belgium_national_football_team|| in the round of 16. Ronaldo finished the tournament with five goals (tied with Czech ||Patrik_Schick||) and one assist, earning him the ||UEFA_European_Championship_Golden_Boot||.  On 1 September, Ronaldo scored two headed goals, with his second coming seconds before the full-time whistle, in a 2–1 home win against the ||Republic_of_Ireland_national_football_team|| in a ||2022_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_(UEFA)|| at the ||Est%C3%A1dio_Algarve||, which saw him pass Ali Daei's international record of 109 goals to become the sole record holder. On 9 October, he scored the opening goal in a 3–0 friendly win over ||Qatar_national_football_team|| at the Estádio Algarve; with his 181st international appearance, he also overtook ||Sergio_Ramos||'s ||List_of_men%27s_footballers_with_100_or_more_international_caps||. In the following match against ||Luxembourg_national_football_team|| on 12 October, also played at the Estádio Algarve, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5–0 win for Portugal, and became the first player to score 10 hat-tricks in men's international football. Player profile Style of play A versatile ||Forward_(association_football)||, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch, and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet. Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional ||Midfielder#Winger|| on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver ||Cross_(football)|| into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his ||Dribbling#Association_football|| and flair, often displaying an array of ||Association_football_tactics_and_skills|| and ||Dummy_(football)||, such as the ||Step_over|| and so-called 'chops' that became his trademark; he has also been known to use the ||Flip_flap_(association_football)||.  Ronaldo controlling the ball on his chest during a ||2010%E2%80%9311_La_Liga|| game against ||UD_Almer%C3%ADa||. At his peak, he was known for his exceptional speed and athleticism. As Ronaldo matured, he underwent a major physical transformation, developing a muscular body type that allowed him to retain possession of the ball under pressure, and strong legs that enabled an outstanding jumping ability. His strength and jumping ability, combined with his elevation, heading accuracy and height of 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1⁄2 in), give him an edge in winning aerial duels. These attributes allow him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently, many of his goals have been headers. Allied with his increased stamina and work-rate, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks. He has also increasingly played a ||Playmaker|| for his team, often dropping deep to pick up the ball, participate in the build-up of plays and create chances for his teammates, courtesy of his vision and passing ability. In his final seasons at United, Ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role, functioning both as a ||Forward_(association_football)#Striker|| and as a ||Forward_(association_football)#Second_striker||, or even as an ||Midfielder#Attacking_midfielder|| on occasion. He developed into a prolific goalscorer, capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot, courtesy of his striking ability. An accurate ||Penalty_kick_(association_football)|| taker, he also became a set piece specialist, renowned for his powerful, ||Curl_(association_football)|| ||Direct_free_kick||. When taking free kicks, Ronaldo is known for using the ||Knuckleball#Association_football|| technique, which was developed by ||Juninho_Pernambucano||. He also adopts a trademark stance before striking the ball, which involves him standing with his legs far apart. Regarding Ronaldo's unique style of taking free kicks, former Manchester United assistant manager ||Mike_Phelan|| commented: "People used to put the ball down, walk away, run up and hit it. He brought in a more dynamic showmanship. He places the ball down, the concentration level is high, he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot. He is the ultimate showman. He has that slight arrogance. When he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs, he is saying 'All eyes on me' and this is going in. He understands the marketing side of it. The way he struts up and places it; the world is watching him."  As Ronaldo entered his thirties he began to ||Dribbling#Association_football|| less. At Real Madrid, Ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role, while his creative and defensive duties became more limited, although not entirely diminished. Initially deployed as a ||Forward_(association_football)#Centre-forward|| by managers ||Manuel_Pellegrini|| and ||Jos%C3%A9_Mourinho||, he was later moved back onto the left wing, though in a free tactical role; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score, or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit. Madrid's counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player, as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats. While he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring, Ronaldo also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role. This unique role has been described by pundits as that of a "false", "attacking", or "goalscoring winger", as Ronaldo effectively almost functioned as a striker at times with his central runs into the penalty area, despite actually playing on the left flank. From 2013 onwards, under manager ||Carlo_Ancelotti||, he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off-the-ball movement and general involvement, completing fewer dribbles and passes per game, and instead focusing on short-distance creating and goalscoring. Since 2017, Ronaldo adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a free-roaming centre forward under manager ||Zinedine_Zidane||, a role in which he continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record; in this position, he earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement both on and off the ball, positional sense, link-up play and finishing, as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers, find space in the box and score from few touches or opportunities. In his first season at Juventus, Ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager ||Massimiliano_Allegri||, depending on whom he was partnered with. While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing, in a 4–2–3–1 or 4–3–3 formation, in which he often switched positions with Mario Mandžukić. In this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball, and be more involved in the build-up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid. Off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates' crosses. On occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside Mandžukić in a 4–3–1–2, 4–4–2, or 3–5–2 formation. He continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club under manager ||Maurizio_Sarri||. Reception "In the six years we had him, you just saw his game grow all the time, and he was a fantastic player. Now you see the complete player. His decision-making, his maturity, his experience, plus all the great skills he has got, they all make him the complete player." —Former manager ||Alex_Ferguson||, January 2013 Ronaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside ||Lionel_Messi||. Winning his first ||Ballon_d%27Or|| in ||2008_Ballon_d%27Or|| by a record-high vote count at age 23, over the next decade Ronaldo has often featured in debates concerning who is the greatest player in history. Acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goal-scoring, he is considered a decisive player who is also a game changer, especially in important and high-pressured situations.  Fans of ||Real_Madrid_C.F.|| (left; Ronaldo's then current club) and ||Manchester_United_F.C.|| (right; Ronaldo's former club) wearing Ronaldo's 7 shirt at the ||2017_UEFA_Super_Cup|| Ronaldo is noted for his work ethic, elite body conditioning and dedication to improvement on the training pitch, as well being regarded as a natural leader. On his longevity and "extraordinary commitment to physical preparation", Adam Bate of ||Sky_Sports|| said: "Dedication is a huge part of staying at the top and Ronaldo's focus is perhaps unparalleled within the game." While stating they were stylistically different players who shared an equal desire to score goals, former Brazil international ||Ronaldo_(Brazilian_footballer)|| praised Cristiano's approach to training, arguing that "there are so few players who take care of their body like he does. I trained because I had to, he does it because he loves it." His drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked about alongside other greats such as ||Pel%C3%A9|| and ||Diego_Maradona|| once retiring. He is credited, along with his compatriot, coach ||Jos%C3%A9_Mourinho||, with inspiring changing fortunes of Portuguese football in 2010s and 2020s. At times, he has been criticised for ||Diving_(association_football)|| when tackled. He was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson, teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player. ||Jonathan_Wilson_(writer)|| of The Guardian opined that Ronaldo had made Juventus, who he joined aged 33 in 2018, weaker, due to "his relative immobility" in his mid-30s, even if his personal goal-scoring output remained high. During his career, Ronaldo has also been described as having an "arrogant image" on the pitch, with Ronaldo stating that he had become a "victim" because of how he was portrayed in the media. He is often seen moaning, gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory, with Ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance. His managers, teammates and various journalists have said that this reputation has caused an unfair image of him. Goal celebrations Scoring goals is the hardest part of the game. Some players don't even score in training! What more can you say about him? He's a genius! —||Roy_Keane||, on Cristiano Ronaldo's prolific goal-scoring record. Ronaldo has adopted several ||Goal_celebration|| throughout his career, including one particular celebration which gained widespread coverage in the media, when he squatted and stared directly into a camera on the sidelines of the pitch with his hand on his chin. After scoring a goal, he usually celebrates with a "storming jump" and "turn", before "landing in spread-eagled fashion" into his "signature power stance", while usually simultaneously exclaiming "Sí" (Spanish and Italian for "yes"). This trademark celebration has been dubbed the "Sii" in the media. Comparisons to Lionel Messi Main article: ||Messi%E2%80%93Ronaldo_rivalry||  Ronaldo with ||Lionel_Messi|| before an ||International_friendly|| between ||Portugal_national_football_team|| and ||Argentina_national_football_team|| in 2011 Both players have scored in multiple ||UEFA_Champions_League|| finals and have regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single season. Sports journalists and pundits regularly weigh the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football or in the history of the game. It has been compared to several ||List_of_sports_rivalries||, among them the ||Muhammad_Ali||–||Joe_Frazier|| rivalry in boxing, the ||Borg%E2%80%93McEnroe_rivalry|| in tennis and the ||Senna%E2%80%93Prost_rivalry|| from ||Formula_One|| motor racing. Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two, Part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players, as Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff, while Messi is portrayed as a shy, humble character. "It's part of my life now. People are bound to compare us. He tries to do his best for his club and for his national team, as I do, and there is a degree of rivalry with both of us trying to do the best for the teams we represent." —Ronaldo commenting on his rivalry with Messi. In a 2012 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying: "I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high." ||Alex_Ferguson||, Ronaldo's manager during his time at Manchester United, opined: "I don't think the rivalry against each other bothers them. I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best." Messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was "only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I've never fought with Cristiano." Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented: "We don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't with a lot of other players." Ronaldo added that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating: "We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing." Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two players faced each other at least twice every season in the world's biggest club game, ||El_Cl%C3%A1sico||, which is among the world's most viewed annual sporting events. In a debate at ||Oxford_Union|| in October 2013, when asked whether FIFA president ||Sepp_Blatter|| preferred Messi or Ronaldo, Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo, claiming "one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other." Real Madrid demanded and promptly received a full apology. In response to Blatter's "commander" on the pitch comment, Ronaldo issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla. In August 2019, Ronaldo and Messi were interviewed while sat next to each other prior to the announcement of the ||UEFA_Men%27s_Player_of_the_Year_Award||, with Ronaldo stating: "I pushed him and he pushed me as well. So it's good to be part of the history of football."
