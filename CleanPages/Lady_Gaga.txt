She is known for her image reinventions and musical versatility. Gaga began performing as a teenager, singing at ||Open_mic|| nights and acting in school plays. She studied at ||Collaborative_Arts_Project_21_(CAP21)||, through ||New_York_University||'s ||Tisch_School_of_the_Arts||, before dropping out to pursue a career in music. After ||Def_Jam_Recordings|| canceled her contract, she worked as a songwriter for ||Sony/ATV_Music_Publishing||, where she signed a joint deal with ||Interscope_Records|| and ||Akon||'s label, ||KonLive_Distribution||, in 2007. Gaga rose to prominence the following year with her debut studio album, ||The_Fame||, and its chart-topping singles "||Just_Dance_(song)||" and "||Poker_Face_(Lady_Gaga_song)||". The album was later reissued to include the ||Extended_play|| ||The_Fame_Monster|| (2009), which yielded the successful singles "||Bad_Romance||", "||Telephone_(song)||", and "||Alejandro_(song)||". Gaga's five succeeding studio albums all debuted atop the US ||Billboard_200||. Her second full-length album, ||Born_This_Way_(album)|| (2011), explored ||Electronic_rock|| and ||Techno-pop|| and sold ||Lists_of_fastest-selling_albums|| in its first week. The ||Born_This_Way_(song)|| became the fastest-selling song on the ||ITunes_Store||, with over one million downloads in less than a week. Following her ||Electronic_dance_music||-influenced third album, ||Artpop|| (2013), and its lead single "||Applause_(Lady_Gaga_song)||", Gaga released the ||Jazz|| album ||Cheek_to_Cheek_(album)|| (2014) with ||Tony_Bennett||, and the ||Soft_rock|| album ||Joanne_(album)|| (2016). She also ventured into acting, playing leading roles in the miniseries ||American_Horror_Story:_Hotel|| (2015–2016), for which she received a ||Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Actress_%E2%80%93_Miniseries_or_Television_Film||, and the critically acclaimed musical drama film ||A_Star_Is_Born_(2018_film)|| (2018). Her contributions to the ||A_Star_Is_Born_(2018_soundtrack)||, which spawned the chart-topping single "||Shallow_(Lady_Gaga_and_Bradley_Cooper_song)||", made her the first woman to win an ||Academy_Award||, ||British_Academy_Film_Awards||, ||Golden_Globe_Awards||, and ||Grammy_Award|| in one year. Gaga returned to her dance-pop roots with her sixth studio album, ||Chromatica|| (2020), which yielded the number-one single "||Rain_on_Me_(Lady_Gaga_and_Ariana_Grande_song)||". She followed this with her second collaborative album with Bennett, ||Love_for_Sale_(Tony_Bennett_and_Lady_Gaga_album)||, and a starring role in the biographical crime film ||House_of_Gucci||, both in 2021. Having sold 124 million records as of 2014, Gaga is one of the world's ||List_of_best-selling_music_artists|| and the only female artist to achieve four singles that sold at least 10 million copies globally. ||List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Lady_Gaga|| include 13 Grammy Awards, 18 ||MTV_Video_Music_Awards||, 16 ||Guinness_World_Records||, awards from the ||Songwriters_Hall_of_Fame|| and the ||Council_of_Fashion_Designers_of_America||, and recognition as ||Billboard_(magazine)||'s Artist of the Year (2010) and ||Billboard_Women_in_Music|| (2015). She has also been included in several ||Forbes||' power rankings and ranked fourth on ||VH1||'s ||The_Greatest_(TV_series)|| (2012). ||Time_(magazine)|| magazine named her one of the ||Time_100|| in 2010 and 2019 and placed her on their All-Time 100 Fashion Icons list. Her philanthropy and activism focus on mental health awareness and ||LGBT_rights_by_country_or_territory||; in 2012, she founded the ||Born_This_Way_Foundation||, a non-profit organization aiming to empower youth, improve mental health, and prevent bullying. Gaga's business ventures include ||Haus_Laboratories||, a vegan cosmetics brand that launched in 2019. Contents Life and career 1986–2004: Early life Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta was born on March 28, 1986, at ||Lenox_Hill_Hospital|| in ||Manhattan||, New York City, to an ||Upper_middle_class_in_the_United_States|| Catholic family. Both of her parents have Italian ancestry. Her parents are ||Cynthia_Germanotta|| (||N%C3%A9e|| Bissett), a philanthropist and business executive, and Internet entrepreneur Joseph Germanotta, and she has a younger sister named ||Natali_Germanotta||. Brought up on the ||Upper_West_Side|| of Manhattan, Gaga said in an interview that her parents came from lower-class families and worked hard for everything. From age eleven, she attended the ||Convent_of_the_Sacred_Heart_(New_York_City)||, a private all-girls Roman Catholic school. Gaga has described her high-school self as "very dedicated, very studious, very disciplined" but also "a bit insecure". She considered herself a ||Outcast_(person)|| and was mocked for "being either too provocative or too eccentric". Gaga began playing the piano at age four when her mother insisted she become "a cultured young woman". She took piano lessons and practiced through her childhood. The lessons taught her to create music by ear, which she preferred over reading sheet music. Her parents encouraged her to pursue music and enrolled her in Creative Arts Camp. As a teenager, she played at ||Open_mic|| nights. Gaga played the lead roles of Adelaide in the play ||Guys_and_Dolls|| and Philia in the play ||A_Funny_Thing_Happened_on_the_Way_to_the_Forum|| at ||Regis_High_School_(New_York_City)||. She also studied ||Method_acting|| at the ||Lee_Strasberg_Theatre_and_Film_Institute|| for ten years. Gaga unsuccessfully auditioned for New York shows, though she did appear in a small role as a high-school student in a 2001 episode of ||The_Sopranos|| titled "||The_Telltale_Moozadell||". She later said of her inclination towards music: I don't know exactly where my affinity for music comes from, but it is the thing that comes easiest to me. When I was like three years old, I may have been even younger, my mom always tells this really embarrassing story of me propping myself up and playing the keys like this because I was too young and short to get all the way up there. Just go like this on the low end of the piano ... I was really, really good at piano, so my first instincts were to work so hard at practicing piano, and I might not have been a natural dancer, but I am a natural musician. That is the thing that I believe I am the greatest at. In 2003, at age 17, Gaga gained early admission to ||Collaborative_Arts_Project_21||, a music school at ||New_York_University|| (NYU)'s ||Tisch_School_of_the_Arts||, and lived in an ||New_York_University_residence_halls||. She studied music there, and improved her songwriting skills by writing essays on art, religion, social issues and politics, including a thesis on pop artists ||Spencer_Tunick|| and ||Damien_Hirst||. In 2005, she withdrew from school during the second semester of her second year to focus on her music career. That year, she also played an unsuspecting diner customer for ||MTV||'s ||Boiling_Points||, a prank reality television show. In a 2014 interview, Gaga said she had been raped at age 19, for which she later underwent mental and physical therapy. She has ||Post-traumatic_stress_disorder|| (PTSD) which she attributes to the incident, and credits support from doctors, family and friends with helping her. Gaga later gave additional details about the rape, including that "the person who raped me ||Pregnancy_from_rape|| on a corner at my parents' house because I was vomiting and sick. Because I'd been being abused. I was locked away in a studio for months." 2005–2007: Career beginnings In 2005, Gaga recorded two songs with hip-hop artist ||Melle_Mel|| for an ||Audio_book|| accompanying Cricket Casey's children's novel The Portal in the Park. She also formed a band called the SGBand with some friends from NYU. They played gigs around New York and became a fixture of the downtown ||Lower_East_Side|| club scene. After the 2006 ||Songwriters_Hall_of_Fame|| New Songwriters Showcase at ||The_Cutting_Room|| in June, talent scout Wendy Starland recommended her to music producer ||Rob_Fusari||. Fusari collaborated with Gaga, who traveled daily to New Jersey, helping to develop her songs and compose new material. The producer said they began dating in May 2006, and claimed to have been the first person to call her "Lady Gaga", which was derived from ||Queen_(band)||'s song "||Radio_Ga_Ga||". Their relationship lasted until January 2007.  Gaga performing at ||Lollapalooza|| in 2007 Fusari and Gaga established a company called Team Lovechild, ||Limited_liability_company|| to promote her career. They recorded and produced ||Electropop|| tracks, sending them to music industry executives. Joshua Sarubin, the head of ||Artists_and_repertoire|| (A&R) at ||Def_Jam_Recordings||, responded positively and, after approval from Sarubin's boss ||L.A._Reid||, Gaga was signed to Def Jam in September 2006. She was dropped from the label three months later and returned to her family home for Christmas. Gaga began performing at ||Neo-burlesque|| shows, which according to her represented freedom. During this time, she met performance artist ||Lady_Starlight||, who helped mold her onstage persona. The pair began performing at downtown club venues like the ||Mercury_Lounge||, ||The_Bitter_End||, and the ||Rockwood_Music_Hall||. Their live performance art piece, known as "Lady Gaga and the Starlight Revue" and billed as "The Ultimate Pop Burlesque Rockshow", was a tribute to 1970s variety acts. They performed at the 2007 ||Lollapalooza|| music festival. Having initially focused on ||Avant-garde|| ||Electronic_dance_music||, Gaga began to incorporate pop melodies and the ||Glam_rock|| style of ||David_Bowie|| and Queen into her songs. While Gaga and Starlight were performing, Fusari continued to develop the songs he had created with her, sending them to the producer and ||Music_executive|| ||Vincent_Herbert||. In November 2007, Herbert signed Gaga to his label Streamline Records, an ||Trade_name|| of Interscope Records, established that month. Gaga later credited Herbert as the man who discovered her. Having served as an apprentice songwriter during an internship at ||Famous_Music|| Publishing, Gaga struck a ||Music_publisher_(popular_music)|| deal with ||Sony/ATV_Music_Publishing||. As a result, she was hired to write songs for ||Britney_Spears||, ||New_Kids_on_the_Block||, ||Fergie_(singer)||, and ||The_Pussycat_Dolls||. At Interscope, musician ||Akon|| was impressed with her singing abilities when she sang a ||Scratch_vocal|| for one of his tracks in studio. Akon convinced ||Jimmy_Iovine||, chairman and CEO of ||Interscope_Geffen_A%26M_Records|| (a brother company for Def Jam), to form a joint deal by having Gaga also sign with his own label ||KonLive_Distribution||, making her his "franchise player". In late 2007, Gaga met with songwriter and producer ||RedOne||. She collaborated with him in the recording studio for a week on her debut album, signing with ||Cherrytree_Records||, an Interscope imprint established by producer and songwriter ||Martin_Kierszenbaum||; she also wrote four songs with Kierszenbaum. Despite securing a record deal, she said that some radio stations found her music too "racy", "dance-oriented", and "underground" for the mainstream market, to which she replied: "My name is Lady Gaga, I've been on the music scene for years, and I'm telling you, this is what's next." 2008–2010: Breakthrough with The Fame and The Fame Monster By 2008, Gaga had relocated to Los Angeles to work extensively with her record label to complete her debut album, ||The_Fame||, and to set up her own creative team called the Haus of Gaga, modeled on ||Andy_Warhol||'s ||The_Factory||. The Fame was released on August 19, 2008, and reached number one in Austria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the UK, as well as the top five in Australia and the US. Its first two singles, "||Just_Dance_(song)||" and "||Poker_Face_(Lady_Gaga_song)||", reached number one in the United States, Australia, Canada and the UK. The latter was also the ||List_of_best-selling_singles#IFPI_best-selling_singles_worldwide_by_year|| of 2009, with 9.8 million copies sold that year, and spent a record 83 weeks on ||Billboard_(magazine)|| magazine's ||Digital_Songs|| chart. Three other singles, "||Eh,_Eh_(Nothing_Else_I_Can_Say)||", "||LoveGame||" and "||Paparazzi_(Lady_Gaga_song)||", were released from the album; the lattermost reached number one in Germany. Remixed versions of the singles from The Fame, except "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)", were included on ||Hitmixes|| in August 2009. At the ||52nd_Annual_Grammy_Awards||, The Fame and "Poker Face" won ||Grammy_Award_for_Best_Dance/Electronic_Album|| and ||Grammy_Award_for_Best_Dance_Recording||, respectively.  Gaga performing on ||The_Monster_Ball_Tour|| in 2010. It grossed $227 million and became the ||List_of_highest-grossing_concert_tours|| for a debut headlining artist. Following her opening act on ||The_Pussycat_Dolls||' 2009 ||Doll_Domination_Tour|| in Europe and Oceania, Gaga headlined her worldwide ||The_Fame_Ball_Tour||, which ran from March to September 2009. While traveling the globe, she wrote eight songs for ||The_Fame_Monster||, a reissue of The Fame. Those new songs were also released as a standalone ||Extended_play|| on November 18, 2009. Its first single, "||Bad_Romance||", was released one month earlier and went number one in Canada and the UK, and number two in the US, Australia and New Zealand. "||Telephone_(song)||", with ||Beyonc%C3%A9||, followed as the second single from the EP and became Gaga's fourth UK number one. Its third single was "||Alejandro_(song)||", which reached number one in Finland and attracted controversy when its music video was deemed ||Blasphemy|| by the ||Catholic_League_(U.S.)||. Both tracks reached the top five in the US. The video for "Bad Romance" became the ||List_of_most-viewed_YouTube_videos|| on YouTube in April 2010, and that October, Gaga became the first person with more than one billion combined views. At the ||2010_MTV_Video_Music_Awards||, she won eight awards from 13 nominations, including ||MTV_Video_Music_Award_for_Video_of_the_Year|| for "Bad Romance". She was the most nominated artist for a single year, and the first woman to receive two nominations for Video of the Year at the same ceremony. The Fame Monster won the ||Grammy_Award_for_Best_Pop_Vocal_Album||, and "Bad Romance" won ||Grammy_Award_for_Best_Female_Pop_Vocal_Performance|| and ||Grammy_Award_for_Best_Short_Form_Music_Video|| at the ||53rd_Annual_Grammy_Awards||. In 2009, Gaga spent a record 150 weeks on the ||UK_Singles_Chart|| and became the most downloaded female act in a year in the US, with 11.1 million downloads sold, earning an entry in the ||Guinness_Book_of_World_Records||. The Fame and The Fame Monster together have since sold more than 15 million copies worldwide. This success allowed Gaga to start her second worldwide concert tour, ||The_Monster_Ball_Tour||, and release ||The_Remix_(Lady_Gaga_album)||, her final record with Cherrytree Records and ||List_of_best-selling_remix_albums||. The Monster Ball Tour ran from November 2009 to May 2011 and grossed $227.4 million, making it the ||List_of_highest-grossing_concert_tours||. Concerts performed at ||Madison_Square_Garden|| in New York City were filmed for an ||HBO|| television special, ||Lady_Gaga_Presents_the_Monster_Ball_Tour:_At_Madison_Square_Garden||. Gaga also performed songs from her albums at the 2009 ||Royal_Variety_Performance||, the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, and the ||2010_Brit_Awards||. Before ||Michael_Jackson||'s death, Gaga was set to take part in his canceled ||This_Is_It_(concert_residency)|| concert series at the ||The_O2_Arena_(London)|| in the UK. During this era, Gaga ventured into business, collaborating with consumer electronics company ||Monster_Cable_Products|| to create in-ear, jewel-encrusted headphones called Heartbeats by Lady Gaga. She also partnered with ||Polaroid_Corporation|| in January 2010 as their creative director and announced a suite of photo-capture products called Grey Label. Her collaboration with her past record producer and ex-boyfriend Rob Fusari led to a lawsuit against her production team, Mermaid Music LLC. At this time, Gaga was tested borderline positive for ||Lupus||, but claimed not to be affected by the symptoms and hoped to maintain a healthy lifestyle. 2011–2014: Born This Way, Artpop, and Cheek to Cheek In February 2011, Gaga released "||Born_This_Way_(song)||", the lead single from her ||Born_This_Way_(album)||. The song sold more than one million copies within five days, earning the Guinness World Record for the fastest selling single on ||ITunes||. It ||List_of_Billboard_Hot_100_chart_achievements_and_milestones#Number-one_debuts|| the ||Billboard_Hot_100||, becoming the 1,000th number-one single in the history of the charts. Its second single "||Judas_(Lady_Gaga_song)||" followed two months later, and "||The_Edge_of_Glory||" served as its third single. Both reached the top 10 in the US and the UK. Her music video for "The Edge of Glory", unlike her previous work, portrays her dancing on a fire escape and walking on a lonely street, without intricate choreography and back-up dancers.  Gaga promoting ||Born_This_Way_(album)|| with performances in Sydney, Australia Born This Way was released on May 23, 2011, and debuted atop the ||Billboard_200|| with first-week sales of ||Lists_of_fastest-selling_albums||. The album sold eight million copies worldwide and received three Grammy nominations, including Gaga's third consecutive nomination for ||Grammy_Award_for_Album_of_the_Year||. ||Rolling_Stone|| listed it among "||Rolling_Stone%27s_500_Greatest_Albums_of_All_Time||" in 2020. Born This Way's following singles were "||You_and_I_(Lady_Gaga_song)||" and "||Marry_the_Night||", which reached numbers six and 29 in the US, respectively. While filming the former's music video, Gaga met and started dating actor ||Taylor_Kinney|| in July 2011, who played her love interest. She also embarked on the ||Born_This_Way_Ball|| tour in April 2012, which was scheduled to conclude the following March, but ended one month earlier when Gaga canceled the remaining dates due to a ||Acetabular_labrum|| tear of her right hip that required surgery. While refunds for the cancellations were estimated to be worth $25 million, the tour grossed $183.9 million globally. In 2011, Gaga also worked with ||Tony_Bennett|| on a ||Jazz|| version of "||The_Lady_Is_a_Tramp||", with ||Elton_John|| on "Hello Hello" for the animated feature film ||Gnomeo_%26_Juliet||, and with ||The_Lonely_Island|| and ||Justin_Timberlake|| on "||3-Way_(The_Golden_Rule)||". She also performed a concert at the ||Sydney_Town_Hall|| in Australia that year to promote Born This Way and to celebrate former US President ||Bill_Clinton||'s 65th birthday. In November, she was featured in a ||Thanksgiving_(United_States)|| television special titled ||A_Very_Gaga_Thanksgiving||, which attracted 5.7 million American viewers and spawned the release of her fourth EP, ||A_Very_Gaga_Holiday||. In 2012, Gaga guest-starred as an animated version of herself in an episode of ||The_Simpsons|| called "||Lisa_Goes_Gaga||", and released her first fragrance, ||Lady_Gaga_Fame||, followed by a second one, ||Eau_de_Gaga||, in 2014. Gaga began work on her third studio album, ||Artpop||, in early 2012, during the Born This Way Ball tour; she crafted the album to mirror "a night at the club". In August 2013, Gaga released the album's lead single "||Applause_(Lady_Gaga_song)||", which reached number one in Hungary, number four in the US, and number five in the UK. A ||Lyric_video|| for Artpop track "||Aura_(song)||" followed in October to accompany ||Robert_Rodriguez||'s ||Machete_Kills||, where she plays an assassin named La Chameleon. The film received generally negative reviews and earned less than half of its $33 million budget. The second Artpop single, "||Do_What_U_Want||", featured singer ||R._Kelly|| and was released later that month, topping the charts in Hungary and reaching number 13 in the US. Artpop was released on November 6, 2013, to mixed reviews. Helen Brown in ||The_Daily_Telegraph|| criticized Gaga for making another album about her fame and doubted the record's originality, but found it "great for dancing". The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart, and sold more than 2.5 million copies worldwide as of July 2014. "||G.U.Y.||" was released as the third single in March 2014 and peaked at number 76 in the US.  With the ||Cheek_to_Cheek_(album)|| era, Gaga (seen here performing on the ||Cheek_to_Cheek_Tour|| alongside ||Tony_Bennett||) ushered in an overhaul of her image. Gaga hosted an episode of ||Saturday_Night_Live|| in November 2013. After holding her second Thanksgiving Day television special on ||American_Broadcasting_Company||, ||Lady_Gaga_and_the_Muppets_Holiday_Spectacular||, she performed a special rendition of "Do What U Want" with ||Christina_Aguilera|| on the ||The_Voice_(U.S._season_5)|| of the American reality talent show ||The_Voice_(U.S._TV_series)||. In March 2014, Gaga had a ||Lady_Gaga_Live_at_Roseland_Ballroom|| commemorating the last performance at New York's ||Roseland_Ballroom|| before its closure. Two months later, she embarked on the ||ArtRave:_The_Artpop_Ball|| tour, building on concepts from her ||ArtRave|| promotional event. Earning $83 million, the tour included cities canceled from the Born This Way Ball tour itinerary. In the meantime, Gaga split from longtime manager ||Troy_Carter_(music_industry)|| over "creative differences", and by June 2014, she and new manager Bobby Campbell joined Artist Nation, the artist management division of ||Live_Nation_Entertainment||. She briefly appeared in Rodriguez's ||Sin_City:_A_Dame_to_Kill_For||, and was confirmed as ||Versace||'s spring-summer 2014 ambassador with a campaign called "Lady Gaga For Versace". In September 2014, Gaga released a collaborative jazz album with Tony Bennett titled ||Cheek_to_Cheek_(album)||. The inspiration behind the album came from her friendship with Bennett, and fascination with jazz music since her childhood. Before the album was released, it produced the singles "||Anything_Goes_(Cole_Porter_song)#Tony_Bennett_and_Lady_Gaga_version||" and "||I_Can%27t_Give_You_Anything_but_Love,_Baby#Tony_Bennett_and_Lady_Gaga_version||". Cheek to Cheek received generally favorable reviews; The Guardian's Caroline Sullivan praised Gaga's vocals and Howard Reich of the ||Chicago_Tribune|| wrote that "Cheek to Cheek serves up the real thing, start to finish". The record was Gaga's third consecutive number-one album on the Billboard 200, and won a ||Grammy_Award_for_Best_Traditional_Pop_Vocal_Album||. The duo recorded the concert special ||Tony_Bennett_and_Lady_Gaga:_Cheek_to_Cheek_Live!||, and embarked on the ||Cheek_to_Cheek_Tour|| from December 2014 to August 2015. 2015–2017: American Horror Story, Joanne, and Super Bowl performances In February 2015, Gaga became engaged to Taylor Kinney. After the lukewarm response to Artpop, Gaga began to reinvent her image and style. According to Billboard, this shift started with the release of Cheek to Cheek and the attention she received for her performance at the ||87th_Academy_Awards||, where she sang a medley of songs from ||The_Sound_of_Music_(film)|| in a tribute to ||Julie_Andrews||. Considered one of her best performances by ||Billboard_(magazine)||, it triggered more than 214,000 interactions per minute globally on Facebook. She and ||Diane_Warren|| co-wrote the song "||Til_It_Happens_to_You||" for the documentary ||The_Hunting_Ground||, which earned them the ||Satellite_Award_for_Best_Original_Song|| and an ||Academy_Award|| nomination in ||Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Song||. Gaga won Billboard ||Billboard_Women_in_Music|| and Contemporary Icon Award at the 2015 Annual Songwriters Hall of Fame Awards. Gaga had spent much of her early life wanting to be an actress, and achieved her goal when she starred in ||American_Horror_Story:_Hotel||. Running from October 2015 to January 2016, Hotel is the fifth season of the television ||Anthology_series|| horror series, ||American_Horror_Story||, in which Gaga played a hotel owner named ||List_of_American_Horror_Story:_Hotel_characters#The_Countess||. At the ||73rd_Golden_Globe_Awards||, Gaga received the ||Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Actress_%E2%80%93_Miniseries_or_Television_Film|| award for her work on the season. She appeared in ||Nick_Knight_(photographer)||'s 2015 fashion film for ||Tom_Ford||'s 2016 spring campaign and was guest editor for ||V_(American_magazine)|| fashion magazine's 99th issue in January 2016, which featured 16 different covers. She received Editor of the Year award at the Fashion Los Angeles Awards.  Gaga performing on the ||Joanne_World_Tour|| in 2017 In February 2016, Gaga sang the ||The_Star-Spangled_Banner|| at ||Super_Bowl_50||, partnered with ||Intel|| and ||Nile_Rodgers|| for a tribute performance to the late David Bowie at the ||58th_Annual_Grammy_Awards||, and sang "Til It Happens to You" at the ||88th_Academy_Awards||, where she was introduced by ||Joe_Biden|| and was accompanied on-stage by 50 people who had suffered from sexual assault. She was honored that April with the Artist Award at the Jane Ortner Education Awards by ||The_Grammy_Museum||, which recognizes artists who have demonstrated passion and dedication to education through the arts. Her engagement to Taylor Kinney ended in July; she later said her career had interfered with their relationship. Gaga played a witch named ||Sc%C3%A1thach|| in ||American_Horror_Story:_Roanoke||, the series' sixth season, which ran from September to November 2016. Her role in the fifth season of the show ultimately influenced her future music, prompting her to feature "the art of darkness". In September 2016, she released her fifth album's lead single, "||Perfect_Illusion||", which topped the charts in France and reached number 15 in the US. The album, titled ||Joanne_(album)||, was named after Gaga's late aunt, who was an inspiration for the music. It was released on October 21, 2016, and became Gaga's fourth number one album on the Billboard 200, making her the first woman to reach the US chart's summit four times in the 2010s. The album's second single, "||Million_Reasons||", followed the next month and reached number four in the US. She later released a piano version of the album's ||Joanne_(Lady_Gaga_song)|| in 2018, which won a ||Grammy_Award_for_Best_Pop_Solo_Performance||. To promote the album, Gaga embarked on the three-date ||Dive_Bar_Tour_(Lady_Gaga)||. Gaga performed as the headlining act during the ||Super_Bowl_LI_halftime_show|| on February 5, 2017. Her performance featured a group of hundreds of lighted drones forming various shapes in the sky above Houston's ||NRG_Stadium||—the first time robotic aircraft appeared in a Super Bowl program. It attracted 117.5 million viewers in the United States, exceeding the game's 113.3 million viewers. The performance led to a surge of 410,000 song downloads in the United States for Gaga and earned her an ||Emmy_Award|| nomination in the ||Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Special_Class_Program|| category. ||CBS_Sports|| included her performance as the second best in the history of Super Bowl halftime shows. In April, Gaga headlined the ||Coachella_Valley_Music_and_Arts_Festival||. She also released a standalone-single, "||The_Cure_(song)||", which reached the top 10 in Australia. In August, Gaga began the ||Joanne_World_Tour||, which she announced after the Super Bowl LI halftime show. Gaga's creation of Joanne and preparation for her halftime show performance were featured in the documentary ||Gaga:_Five_Foot_Two||, which premiered on ||Netflix|| that September. Throughout the film, she was seen suffering from ||Chronic_pain||, which was later revealed to be the effect of a long-term condition called ||Fibromyalgia||. In February 2018, it prompted Gaga to cancel the last ten shows of the Joanne World Tour, which ultimately grossed $95 million from 842,000 tickets sold. 2018–2020: A Star Is Born, Vegas residency, and Chromatica In March 2018, Gaga supported the ||March_for_Our_Lives|| gun-control rally in Washington, D.C., and released a cover of Elton John's "||Your_Song||" for his tribute album ||Revamp_%26_Restoration#Revamp||. Later that year, she starred as struggling singer Ally in ||Bradley_Cooper||'s musical romantic drama ||A_Star_Is_Born_(2018_film)||, a remake of the ||A_Star_Is_Born_(1937_film)||. The film follows Ally's relationship with singer Jackson Maine (played by Cooper), which becomes strained after her career begins to overshadow his. It received acclaim from critics, with a consensus that the movie had "appealing leads, deft direction, and an affecting love story". Cooper approached Gaga after seeing her perform at a cancer research fundraiser. An admirer of Cooper's work, Gaga agreed to the project due to its portrayal of addiction and depression. A Star Is Born premiered at the ||75th_Venice_International_Film_Festival||, and was released worldwide that October. Gaga's performance was acclaimed by film critics, with ||Peter_Bradshaw|| of ||The_Guardian|| labeling the film "outrageously watchable" and stating that "Gaga's ability to be part ordinary person, part extraterrestrial celebrity empress functions at the highest level"; ||Stephanie_Zacharek|| of ||Time_(magazine)|| magazine similarly highlighted her "knockout performance" and found her to be "charismatic" without her usual makeup, wigs and costumes. For the role, Gaga won the ||National_Board_of_Review_Award_for_Best_Actress|| and ||Critics%27_Choice_Movie_Award_for_Best_Actress|| awards for Best Actress, in addition to receiving nominations for the ||Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress||, ||Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Actress_in_a_Motion_Picture_%E2%80%93_Drama||, ||Screen_Actors_Guild_Award_for_Outstanding_Performance_by_a_Female_Actor_in_a_Leading_Role|| and ||BAFTA_Award_for_Best_Actress_in_a_Leading_Role|| for Best Actress.  Gaga at the ||2018_Toronto_International_Film_Festival|| prior to the screening of ||A_Star_Is_Born_(2018_film)|| Gaga and Cooper co-wrote and produced most of the songs on the ||A_Star_Is_Born_(2018_soundtrack)||, which she insisted they perform live in the film. Its lead single, "||Shallow_(Lady_Gaga_and_Bradley_Cooper_song)||", performed by the two, was released on September 27, 2018 and topped the charts in various countries including Australia, the UK and the US. The soundtrack contains 34 tracks, including 17 original songs, and received generally positive reviews; Mark Kennedy of ||The_Washington_Post|| called it a "five-star marvel" and Ben Beaumont-Thomas of The Guardian termed it an "instant classics full of Gaga's emotional might". Commercially, the soundtrack debuted at number one in the US, making Gaga the first woman with five US number-one albums in the 2010s, and breaking her tie with ||Taylor_Swift|| as the most for any female artist this decade; Swift tied with her again in 2019. It additionally topped the charts in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Switzerland and the UK. As of June 2019, the soundtrack had sold over six million copies worldwide. The album won Gaga four Grammy Awards—||Grammy_Award_for_Best_Compilation_Soundtrack_for_Visual_Media|| and ||Grammy_Award_for_Best_Pop_Duo/Group_Performance|| and ||Grammy_Award_for_Best_Song_Written_for_Visual_Media|| for "Shallow", as well as the latter category for "||I%27ll_Never_Love_Again||"—and a ||BAFTA_Award_for_Best_Film_Music||. "Shallow" also won her the Academy Award, ||Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Original_Song||, and ||Critics%27_Choice_Movie_Award_for_Best_Song|| for Best Original Song. In October, Gaga announced her engagement to talent agent Christian Carino whom she had met in early 2017. They ended the engagement in February 2019. Gaga signed a ||Concert_residency||, named ||Lady_Gaga_Enigma_%2B_Jazz_%26_Piano||, to perform at the ||Monte_Carlo_Resort_and_Casino|| in ||Las_Vegas||. The residency consists of two types of shows: Enigma, which focused on theatricality and included Gaga's biggest hits, and Jazz & Piano, which involved tracks from the ||Great_American_Songbook|| and stripped-down versions of Gaga's songs. The Enigma show opened in December 2018 and the Jazz & Piano in January 2019. Gaga launched her ||Vegan|| makeup line, ||Haus_Laboratories||, in September 2019 exclusively on ||Amazon_(company)||. Consisting of 40 products, including liquid eyeliners, lip glosses and face mask sticker, it reached number-one on Amazon's list of best-selling lipsticks. In February 2020, Gaga began a relationship with entrepreneur Michael Polansky. Gaga's sixth studio album, ||Chromatica||, was released on May 29, 2020, to positive reviews. It debuted atop the US charts, becoming her sixth consecutive number-one album in the country, and reached the top spot in more than a dozen other territories including Australia, Canada, France, Italy and the UK. Chromatica was preceded by two singles, "||Stupid_Love_(Lady_Gaga_song)||", on February 28, 2020, and "||Rain_on_Me_(Lady_Gaga_and_Ariana_Grande_song)||", with ||Ariana_Grande||, on May 22. The latter won the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the ||63rd_Annual_Grammy_Awards||, and debuted at number one in the US, making Gaga the third person to top the country's chart in the 2000s, 2010s and 2020s. At the ||2020_MTV_Video_Music_Awards||, Gaga won five awards, including the inaugural Tricon Award recognizing artists accomplished in different areas of the entertainment industry. In September 2020, she appeared in the video campaign for ||Valentino_(fashion_house)||'s Voce Viva fragrance, singing a stripped-down version of Chromatica track "||Sine_from_Above||", along with a group of models. 2021–present: Love for Sale and House of Gucci  Gaga singing "||The_Star-Spangled_Banner||" at the ||Inauguration_of_Joe_Biden|| in 2021 During the ||Inauguration_of_Joe_Biden|| as the 46th President of the United States on January 20, 2021, Gaga sang the US national anthem. In February 2021, her dog walker Ryan Fischer was hospitalized after getting shot in Hollywood. Two of her ||French_Bulldog||, Koji and Gustav, were taken while a third dog named Miss Asia escaped and was subsequently recovered by police. Gaga later offered a $500,000 reward for the return of her pets. Two days later, on February 26, a woman brought the dogs to a police station in Los Angeles. Both were unharmed. ||Los_Angeles_Police|| initially said the woman who dropped off the dogs did not appear to be involved with the shooting, but on April 29, she was one of five people charged in connection with the shooting and theft. In April 2021, Gaga teamed up with Champagne brand ||Dom_P%C3%A9rignon||, and appeared in an ad shot by Nick Knight. On September 3, she released her third remix album, ||Dawn_of_Chromatica||. This was followed by her second collaborative album with Tony Bennett, titled ||Love_for_Sale_(Tony_Bennett_and_Lady_Gaga_album)||, on September 30. The record received generally favorable reviews, and debuted at number eight in the US. To promote it, they presented a pair of shows at ||Radio_City_Music_Hall||, on August 3 and 5, called One Last Time: an Evening with Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga. An hour-long special, featuring performances from the concerts, simultaneously premiered on ||CBS|| and ||Paramount%2B|| on November 28, 2021. Another taped performance by the duo recorded for ||MTV_Unplugged|| was released on December 16, 2021, and a documentary called The Lady and the Legend, which will include footage from the making of Gaga and Bennett's two collaborative albums, will be available exclusively on Paramount+ in 2022. At the ||64th_Annual_Grammy_Awards||, Love for Sale won Gaga and Bennett the award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album. After an appearance in the television special ||Friends:_The_Reunion||, in which Gaga sang "||Smelly_Cat||" with ||Lisa_Kudrow||, she portrayed ||Patrizia_Reggiani||, who was convicted of hiring a hitman to murder her ex-husband and former head of the ||Gucci|| fashion house ||Maurizio_Gucci|| (played by ||Adam_Driver||), in ||Ridley_Scott||'s biographical crime film titled ||House_of_Gucci||. For the part, Gaga learned to speak with an Italian accent. She also stayed in character for 18 months, speaking with an accent for nine months during that period. Her ||Method_acting|| approach took a toll on her mental wellbeing, and towards the end of filming she had to be accompanied on-set by a ||Psychiatric_nurse||. While the film received mixed reviews, critics praised Gaga's performance as "note-perfect". She earned the ||New_York_Film_Critics_Circle_Award_for_Best_Actress||, and nominations for the ||75th_British_Academy_Film_Awards||, ||27th_Critics%27_Choice_Awards||, ||79th_Golden_Globe_Awards|| and ||28th_Screen_Actors_Guild_Awards|| for Best Actress. Artistry Influences Musicians such as ||Madonna|| and ||David_Bowie|| have influenced Gaga. Gaga grew up listening to artists such as Michael Jackson, ||The_Beatles||, ||Stevie_Wonder||, Queen, ||Bruce_Springsteen||, ||Pink_Floyd||, ||Led_Zeppelin||, ||Whitney_Houston||, Elton John, Christina Aguilera and ||Blondie_(band)||, who have all influenced her music. Gaga's musical inspiration varies from ||Dance-pop|| singers such as Madonna and Michael Jackson to glam rock artists such as David Bowie and ||Freddie_Mercury||, as well as the theatrics of the ||Pop_art|| Andy Warhol and her own performance roots in musical theater. She has been compared to Madonna, who has said that she sees herself reflected in Gaga. Gaga says that she wants to revolutionize pop music as Madonna has. Gaga has also cited heavy metal bands as an influence, specifically ||Iron_Maiden||, ||Black_Sabbath|| and ||Marilyn_Manson_(band)||. She credits Beyoncé as a key inspiration to pursue a musical career. Gaga was inspired by her mother to be interested in fashion, which she now says is a major influence and integrated with her music. Stylistically, Gaga has been compared to ||Leigh_Bowery||, ||Isabella_Blow||, and ||Cher||; she once commented that as a child, she absorbed Cher's fashion sense and made it her own. She considers ||Donatella_Versace|| her ||Muse|| and the British fashion designer ||Alexander_McQueen|| as an inspiration. In turn, Versace calls Lady Gaga "the fresh Donatella". Gaga has also been influenced by ||Diana,_Princess_of_Wales||, whom she has admired since her childhood. Gaga has called the Indian ||Alternative_medicine|| advocate ||Deepak_Chopra|| a "true inspiration", and has also quoted Indian leader ||Rajneesh||'s book Creativity on Twitter. Gaga says she was influenced by Osho's work in valuing rebellion through creativity and equality. Musical style and themes Critics have analyzed and scrutinized Gaga's musical and performance style, as she has experimented with new ideas and images throughout her career. She says the continual reinvention is "liberating" herself, which she has been drawn to since childhood. Gaga is a ||Contralto||, with a ||Vocal_range|| spanning from ||B%E2%99%AD_(musical_note)|| to ||B_(musical_note)||. She has changed her vocal style regularly, and considers Born This Way "much more vocally up to par with what I've always been capable of". In summing up her voice, ||Entertainment_Weekly|| wrote: "There's an immense emotional intelligence behind the way she uses her voice. Almost never does she overwhelm a song with her vocal ability, recognizing instead that artistry is to be found in nuance rather than lung power." Gaga's songs have been called "depthless" by writer ||Camille_Paglia|| in ||The_Sunday_Times||, but according to Evan Sawdey of ||PopMatters||, she "does manage to get you moving and grooving at an almost effortless pace". Gaga believes that "all good music can be played on a piano and still sound like a hit". ||Simon_Reynolds|| wrote in 2010, "Everything about Gaga came from ||Electroclash||, except the music, which wasn't particularly 1980s, just ruthlessly catchy ||Noughties|| pop glazed with ||Auto-Tune|| and undergirded with ||Contemporary_R%26B||-ish beats." Gaga's songs have covered a wide variety of concepts; The Fame discusses the lust for stardom, while the follow-up The Fame Monster expresses fame's dark side through ||Paranoia|| metaphors. The Fame is an electropop and dance-pop album that has influences of 1980s pop and 1990s ||Europop||, whereas The Fame Monster displays Gaga's taste for pastiche, drawing on "Seventies arena glam, perky ||ABBA|| ||Disco||, and sugary throwbacks like ||Stacey_Q||". Born This Way has lyrics in English, French, German, and Spanish and features themes common to Gaga's controversial songwriting such as sex, love, religion, money, drugs, identity, liberation, sexuality, freedom, and individualism. The album explores new genres, such as ||Electronic_rock|| and ||Techno||. The themes in Artpop revolve around Gaga's personal views of fame, love, sex, ||Feminism||, self-empowerment, overcoming addiction, and reactions to media scrutiny. Billboard describes Artpop as "coherently channeling R&B, techno, disco and rock music". With Cheek to Cheek, Gaga dabbled in the jazz genre. Joanne, exploring the genres of country, funk, pop, dance, rock, electronic music and folk, was influenced by her personal life. The A Star Is Born soundtrack contains elements of ||Blues_rock||, country and ||Bubblegum_pop||. Billboard says its lyrics are about wanting change, its struggle, love, romance, and bonding, describing the music as "timeless, emotional, gritty and earnest. They sound like songs written by artists who, quite frankly, are supremely messed up but hit to the core of the listener." On Chromatica, Gaga returned to her dance-pop roots, and discussed her struggles with mental health. Her second album with Tony Bennett, Love for Sale, consists of a tribute to ||Cole_Porter||. Videos and stage  Gaga during a "blood soaked" performance in 2010 Featuring constant costume changes and provocative visuals, Gaga's music videos are often described as short films. The video for "Telephone" earned Gaga the Guinness World Record for Most Product Placement in a Video. According to author Curtis Fogel, she explores ||Bondage_(sexual)|| and ||Sadomasochism|| and highlights prevalent feminist themes. The main themes of her music videos are sex, violence, and power. She calls herself "a little bit of a feminist" and asserts that she is "sexually empowering women". Billboard ranked her sixth on its list of "The 100 Greatest Music Video Artists of All Time" in 2020, stating that "the name 'Lady Gaga' will forever be synonymous with culture-shifting music videos." Gaga has called herself a perfectionist when it comes to her elaborate shows. Her performances have been described as "highly entertaining and innovative"; the blood-spurting performance of "Paparazzi" at the ||2009_MTV_Video_Music_Awards|| was described as "eye-popping" by MTV News. She continued the blood-soaked theme during The Monster Ball Tour, causing protests in England from family groups and fans in the aftermath of the ||Cumbria_shootings||, in which a taxi driver had killed 12 people, then himself. At the ||2011_MTV_Video_Music_Awards||, Gaga appeared in ||Drag_(clothing)|| as her male ||Alter_ego||, Jo Calderone, and delivered a lovesick monologue before a performance of her song "You and I". As Gaga's choreographer and creative director, ||Laurieann_Gibson|| provided material for her shows and videos for four years before she was replaced by her assistant ||Richard_%22Richy%22_Jackson_(choreographer)|| in 2014. In an October 2018 article for Billboard, Rebecca Schiller traced back Gaga's videography from "Just Dance" to the release of A Star Is Born. Schiller noted how, following the Artpop era, Gaga's stripped-down approach to music was reflected in the clips for the singles from Joanne, taking the example of the music video of lead single "Perfect Illusion" where the singer "[ditched] the elaborate outfits for shorts and a tee-shirt as she performed the song at a desert party". It continued with her performances in the film as well as her stage persona. Public image  In 2010, eight wax figures of Gaga were installed at the museum ||Madame_Tussauds||. Public reception of her music, fashion sense, and persona is polarized. Because of her influence on modern culture, and her rise to global fame, sociologist Mathieu Deflem of the ||University_of_South_Carolina|| has offered a course titled "Lady Gaga and the Sociology of the Fame" since early 2011 with the objective of unraveling "some of the sociologically relevant dimensions of the fame of Lady Gaga". When Gaga met briefly with then-president ||Barack_Obama|| at a ||Human_Rights_Campaign|| fundraiser, he found the interaction "intimidating" as she was dressed in 16-inch heels, making her the tallest woman in the room. When interviewed by ||Barbara_Walters|| for her annual ||ABC_News|| special ||Barbara_Walters%27_10_Most_Fascinating_People|| in 2009, Gaga dismissed the claim that she is ||Intersex|| as an ||Urban_legend||. Responding to a question on this issue, she expressed her fondness for ||Androgyny||. In a 2010 ||Sunday_Times|| article, ||Camille_Paglia|| called Gaga "more an identity thief than an erotic taboo breaker, a mainstream manufactured product who claims to be singing for the freaks, the rebellious and the dispossessed when she is none of those". Gaga's outlandish fashion sense has also served as an important aspect of her character. During her early career, members of the media compared her fashion choices to those of Christina Aguilera. In 2011, 121 women gathered at the ||53rd_Annual_Grammy_Awards|| dressed in costumes similar to those worn by Gaga, earning the 2011 Guinness World Record for Largest Gathering of Lady Gaga Impersonators. The ||Global_Language_Monitor|| named "Lady Gaga" as the Top Fashion Buzzword with her trademark "no pants" a close third. ||Entertainment_Weekly|| put her outfits on its end of the decade "best-of" list, saying that she "brought performance art into the mainstream". ||People_(magazine)|| ranked her number one on their "Best Dressed Stars of 2021" list, writing that Gaga "strutted the streets in high-fashion designs, from a sculptural seersucker number to a black lace corseted gown—accessorizing each with elegant updos, sky-high heels and retro shades—like it was no sweat." ||Time_(magazine)|| placed Gaga on their All-Time 100 Fashion Icons list, stating: "Lady Gaga is just as notorious for her outrageous style as she is for her pop hits ... [Gaga] has sported outfits made from plastic bubbles, ||Kermit_the_Frog|| dolls, and raw meat." Gaga wore a ||Lady_Gaga%27s_meat_dress|| to the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, which was supplemented by boots, a purse, and a hat also made out of raw beef. Partly awarded in recognition of the dress, ||Vogue_(magazine)|| named her one of the Best Dressed people of 2010 and Time named the dress the Fashion Statement of the year. It attracted the attention of worldwide media; the animal rights organization ||People_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals|| found it offensive. The meat dress was displayed at the ||National_Museum_of_Women_in_the_Arts|| in 2012, and entered the ||Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame|| in September 2015. Gaga's fans call her "Mother Monster", and she often refers to them as "Little Monsters", a phrase which she had tattooed on herself in dedication. In his article "Lady Gaga Pioneered Online Fandom Culture As We Know It" for ||Vice_(magazine)||, Jake Hall wrote that Gaga inspired several subsequent fan-brandings, such as those of Taylor Swift, ||Rihanna|| and ||Justin_Bieber||. In July 2012, Gaga also co-founded the ||Social_networking_service|| LittleMonsters.com, devoted to her fans. According to Guinness World Records, she was the most followed person on Twitter from 2011 to 2013, the most famous celebrity in 2013, and the most powerful popstar in 2014. She was included on ||Forbes||' ||Forbes_Celebrity_100|| from 2010 to 2015 and then from 2018 to 2020, having topped the list in 2011. She earned $62 million, $90 million, $52 million, $80 million, $33 million, and $59 million from 2010 through 2015, and $50 million, $39 million and $38 million between 2018 and 2020. Gaga also appeared on their list of the ||Forbes_list_of_The_World%27s_100_Most_Powerful_Women|| from 2010 to 2014. She was named one of the ||Time_100|| by Time magazine in 2010 and 2019, and ranked second in its most influential people of the past ten years readers' poll in 2013. Billboard named Gaga the Greatest Pop Star in 2009, and gave her an honorable mention in 2010 and 2011. In March 2012, Gaga was ranked fourth on Billboard's list of top moneymakers of 2011 with earnings of $25 million, which included sales from Born This Way and her Monster Ball Tour. The following year, she topped Forbes' List of Top-Earning Celebs Under 30, which she also topped in 2011, and in February 2016, the magazine estimated her net worth to be $275 million. In December 2019, Gaga placed 10th on Forbes' list of Top-Earning Musicians of the Decade with earnings of $500 million in the 2010s. She was the fourth highest-earning female musician on the list. Activism Philanthropy After declining an invitation to appear on the single "||We_Are_the_World_25_for_Haiti||", because of rehearsals for her tour, to benefit victims of the ||2010_Haiti_earthquake||, Gaga donated the proceeds of her January 2010 ||Radio_City_Music_Hall|| concert to the country's reconstruction relief fund. All profits from her online store that day were also donated, and Gaga announced that $500,000 was collected for the fund. Hours after the ||2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami|| hit Japan, Gaga tweeted a link to Japan Prayer Bracelets. All revenue from a bracelet she designed in conjunction with the company was donated to relief efforts; these raised $1.5 million. In June 2011, Gaga performed at ||MTV_Japan||'s charity show in ||Makuhari_Messe||, which benefited the ||Japanese_Red_Cross||. In 2012, Gaga joined the campaign group ||Artists_Against_Fracking||. That October, ||Yoko_Ono|| gave Gaga and four other activists the ||LennonOno_Grant_for_Peace|| in ||Reykjav%C3%ADk||, Iceland. The following month, Gaga pledged to donate $1 million to the American Red Cross to help the victims of ||Hurricane_Sandy||. Gaga also contributes in the fight against ||HIV/AIDS||, focusing on educating young women about the risks of the disease. In collaboration with ||Cyndi_Lauper||, Gaga joined forces with ||Make-up_Art_Cosmetics|| to launch a line of lipstick under their supplementary cosmetic line, Viva Glam. Sales have raised more than $202 million to fight HIV and AIDS. In April 2016, Gaga joined Vice President Joe Biden at the ||University_of_Nevada,_Las_Vegas|| to support Biden's ||White_House_Task_Force_to_Protect_Students_from_Sexual_Assault|| campaign as he traveled to colleges on behalf of the organization, which has seen 250,000 students from more than 530 colleges sign a pledge of solidarity and activism. Two months later, Gaga attended the ||United_States_Conference_of_Mayors|| in Indianapolis where she joined with the ||14th_Dalai_Lama|| to talk about the power of kindness and how to make the world a more compassionate place. Due to her meeting with Dalai Lama, the ||Chinese_government|| added Gaga to a list of hostile foreign forces, and Chinese websites and media organizations were ordered to stop uploading or distributing her songs. The ||Publicity_Department_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China|| (CCPPD) also issued an order for state-controlled media to condemn this meeting. In April 2020, Gaga curated the televised benefit concert, ||Together_at_Home||, a collaboration with Global Citizen to benefit the ||World_Health_Organization||'s ||COVID-19_Solidarity_Response_Fund||. The special raised $127 million, which according to Forbes "puts it on par with the other legendary fundraiser, ||Live_Aid||, as the highest grossing charity concert in history." In recognition of her contribution to the ||Black_Lives_Matter|| movement, Gaga received the ||Yolanda_Denise_King|| High Ground Award from the ||King_Center_for_Nonviolent_Social_Change||'s Beloved Community Awards in January 2021. In her acceptance speech, she denounced racism and white supremacy and addressed her social responsibility as a high-profile artist and white woman. Born This Way Foundation Main article: ||Born_This_Way_Foundation||  Gaga during an event for the ||Born_This_Way_Foundation|| in Europe, 2013 In 2012, Gaga launched the ||Born_This_Way_Foundation|| (BTWF), a non-profit organization that focuses on youth empowerment. It takes its name from her 2011 single and album. Media proprietor ||Oprah_Winfrey||, writer Deepak Chopra, and US Secretary of Health and Human Services ||Kathleen_Sebelius|| spoke at the foundation's inauguration at ||Harvard_University||. The foundation's original funding included $1.2 million from Gaga, $500,000 from the MacArthur Foundation, and $850,000 from ||Barneys_New_York||. In July 2012, the BTWF partnered with ||Office_Depot||, which donated 25% of the sales, a minimum of $1 million of a series of limited edition back-to-school products. The foundation's initiatives have included the "Born Brave Bus" that followed her on tour as a youth drop-in center as an initiative against bullying. In October 2015, at the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, Gaga joined 200 high school students, policy makers, and academic officials, including ||Peter_Salovey||, to discuss ways to recognize and channel emotions for positive outcomes. In 2016, the foundation partnered with Intel, ||Vox_Media||, and ||Recode|| to fight online harassment. The sales revenue of the 99th issue of the V magazine, which featured Gaga and Kinney, was donated to the foundation. Gaga and Elton John released the clothing and accessories line Love Bravery at ||Macy%27s|| in May. 25% of each purchase support Gaga's foundation and the ||Elton_John_AIDS_Foundation||. Gaga partnered with ||Starbucks|| for a week in June 2017 with the "Cups of Kindness" campaign, where the company donated 25 cents from some of the beverages sold to the foundation. She also appeared in a video by ||Staples_Inc.|| to raise funds for the foundation and DonorsChoose.org. On the 2018 ||World_Kindness_Day||, Gaga partnered with the foundation to bring food and relief to a ||Red_Cross|| shelter for people who have been forced to evacuate homes due to the ||2018_California_wildfires||. The foundation also partnered with Starbucks and ||SoulCycle|| to thank California firefighters for their relief work during the crisis. The singer had to previously evacuate her own home during the ||Woolsey_Fire|| which spread through parts of Malibu. In March 2019, she penned a letter to supporters of the Born This Way Foundation, announcing the launch of a new pilot program for a teen mental health first aid project with the National Council for Behavioral Health. Gaga revealed her personal struggles with ||Mental_health|| in her letter and how she was able to get support which saved her life: "I know what it means to have someone support me and understand what I'm going through, and every young person in the world should have someone to turn to when they're hurting. It saved my life, and it will save theirs." In September 2020, Gaga released an anthology book, Channel Kindness: Stories of Kindness and Community, featuring fifty-one stories about kindness, bravery, and resilience from young people all over the world collected by the Born This Way Foundation, and introduced by herself. She had been promoting it with a 21 days of kindness challenge on her social media, using the "BeKind21" hashtag. In 2021, Gaga collaborated with the Champagne house Dom Pérignon to release a limited edition of Rosé Vintage 2005 bottles along with a sculpture designed by her. The 110 exclusive pieces will be sold at private sales, and the profits will benefit the foundation. On the 2021 World Kindness Day, Gaga released a 30-minute special, titled The Power of Kindness, as part of the foundation's Channel Kindness program, in which together with a mental health expert and a group of eleven young people, she explored the connection between kindness and mental health. LGBT advocacy  Gaga speaking against "||Don%27t_ask,_don%27t_tell||" in ||Portland,_Maine|| (2010) Gaga is a bisexual woman and actively supports ||LGBT_rights_by_country_or_territory||. She attributes much of her early success as a mainstream artist to her ||Homosexuality|| fans and is considered a gay icon. Early in her career she had difficulty getting ||Airplay||, and stated, "The turning point for me was the gay community." She thanked FlyLife, a Manhattan-based ||LGBT|| marketing company with whom her label Interscope works, in the liner notes of The Fame. One of her first televised performances was in May 2008 at the ||NewNowNext_Awards||, an awards show aired by the LGBT television network ||Logo_(TV_channel)||. Gaga spoke at the 2009 ||National_Equality_March|| in Washington in support of the LGBT movement. She attended the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards accompanied by four gay and lesbian former members of the ||United_States_Armed_Forces|| who had been unable to serve ||Coming_out|| under the US military's "||Don%27t_ask,_don%27t_tell||" policy, which banned open homosexuality in the military. Gaga urged her fans via YouTube to contact their senators in an effort to overturn the policy. In September 2010, she spoke at a ||Servicemembers_Legal_Defense_Network||'s rally in ||Portland,_Maine||. Following this event, ||The_Advocate_(LGBT_magazine)|| named her a "fierce advocate" for gays and lesbians. Gaga appeared at ||Europride||, an international event dedicated to LGBT pride, in Rome in June 2011. She criticized the poor state of ||LGBT_rights_in_Europe|| and described gay people as "revolutionaries of love". Later that year, she was referenced by teenager ||Suicide_of_Jamey_Rodemeyer|| in the hours prior to his death, with Rodemeyer having tweeted "@ladygaga bye mother monster, thank you for all you have done, paws up forever". Rodemeyer's suicide prompted Gaga to meet with then-President Barack Obama in order to address anti-gay bullying in US schools. In 2011, she was also ordained as a minister by the ||Universal_Life_Church_Monastery|| so that she could officiate the wedding of two female friends. In June 2016, during a vigil held in Los Angeles for victims of the ||Orlando_nightclub_shooting|| in Orlando, Gaga read aloud the names of the 49 people killed in the attack, and gave a speech. Later that month, Gaga appeared in ||Human_Rights_Campaign||'s tribute video to the victims of the attack. She opposed the ||Presidency_of_Donald_Trump|| and his military transgender ban. She supported former Secretary of State ||Hillary_Clinton|| for president in ||2016_United_States_presidential_election||. In 2018, a leaked memo from Trump's office revealed that his administration wanted to change the legal definition of sex to exclude ||Transgender|| Americans. Gaga was one of the many celebrities to call him out and spread the #WontBeErased campaign to her 77 million Twitter followers. In January 2019, during one of her Enigma shows, she criticized Vice President ||Mike_Pence|| for his wife ||Karen_Pence|| working at an evangelical Christian school where LGBTQ people are turned away, calling him "the worst representation of what it means to be a Christian". Gaga also stated "I am a Christian woman, and what I do know about Christianity is that we bear no prejudice, and everybody is welcome". Impact  Gaga performing on the ||ArtRave:_The_Artpop_Ball|| tour in 2014 Gaga was named the "||Honorific_nicknames_in_popular_music#G||" in a 2011 ranking by Rolling Stone based on record sales and social media metrics. In 2012, she ranked fourth in ||VH1||'s ||The_Greatest_(TV_series)|| and became a feature of the temporary exhibition The Elevated. From the Pharaoh to Lady Gaga, which marked the 150th anniversary of the ||National_Museum,_Warsaw||. Gaga has often been regarded as a trailblazer for using controversy to bring attention to various issues. According to Frankie Graddon of The Independent, Gaga—who wore a meat dress to highlight her distaste for the US military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy—influenced protest dressing on red carpet. Because of The Fame's success—it was listed as one of the 100 Greatest Debut Albums of All-Time by Rolling Stone in 2013—Gaga has been credited as one of the musicians that popularized synthpop in the late 2000s and early 2010s. Scott Hardy, CEO of Polaroid, praised Gaga for inspiring fans and for her close interactions with them on social media. According to ||Kelefa_Sanneh|| of ||The_New_Yorker||, "Lady Gaga blazed a trail for truculent pop stars by treating her own celebrity as an evolving art project." Including Born This Way as one of the 50 best female albums of all time, Rolling Stone's ||Rob_Sheffield|| considers it "hard to remember a world where we didn't have Gaga, although we're pretty sure it was a lot more boring." In 2015, Time also noted that Gaga had "practically invented the current era of pop music as spectacle." A 2017 journal published by ||Psychology_of_Aesthetics,_Creativity,_and_the_Arts|| studying structural patterns in the melodies of ||Earworm|| songs compiled lists of ||Catchiness|| tracks from 3,000 participants, in which Gaga's "Bad Romance", "Alejandro" and "Poker Face" respectively ranked number one, eight and nine. Gaga and her work have influenced various artists including ||Miley_Cyrus||, ||Nicki_Minaj||, ||Ellie_Goulding||, ||Halsey_(singer)||, ||Jennifer_Lopez||, Beyoncé, ||Nick_Jonas||, ||Sam_Smith_(singer)||, ||Noah_Cyrus||, ||Katherine_Langford||, ||MGMT||, ||Allie_X||, ||Greyson_Chance||, ||Cardi_B||, ||Rina_Sawayama||, ||Blackpink||, ||Madison_Beer||, ||Ren_(singer)||, ||Slayyyter||, ||Bebe_Rexha||, ||Bree_Runway||, ||Celeste_(singer)||, ||Kim_Petras||, ||Jojo_Siwa||, ||Pabllo_Vittar||, ||Ava_Max||, ||Doja_Cat||, ||Chaeyoung||, ||Kanye_West||, ||Rachel_Zegler||, and ||SZA||. A new genus of ||Fern||, ||Gaga_(plant)||, and three species, G. germanotta, G. monstraparva and ||Kaikaia_gaga||, have been named in her honor. The name monstraparva alluded to Gaga's fans, known as Little Monsters, since their symbol is the outstretched "monster claw" hand, which resembles a tightly rolled young fern leaf prior to unfurling. Gaga also has an extinct mammal, ||Gagadon|| minimonstrum, and a parasitic wasp, ||Aleiodes_gaga||, named for her. In May 2021, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of Born This Way and its cultural impact, ||West_Hollywood,_California|| mayor, Lindsey P. Horvath, presented a ||Key_to_the_city|| to Gaga and declared May 23 as "Born This Way Day." A street painting with the Daniel Quasar's version of the ||Rainbow_flag_(LGBT)|| (which includes trans and queer people of color) featuring the album's title was also unveiled on ||Robertson_Boulevard_(Los_Angeles)|| as a tribute to the album, and how it has inspired the LGBT community over the years. Achievements See also: ||List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Lady_Gaga|| Gaga has won thirteen ||Grammy_Awards||, an Academy Award, two ||Golden_Globe_Awards||, a ||British_Academy_Film_Awards||, three ||Brit_Awards||, sixteen ||Guinness_World_Records||, and the inaugural Songwriters Hall of Fame's Contemporary Icon Award. She received a ||National_Arts_Awards||' Young Artist Award, which honors individuals who have shown accomplishments and leadership early in their career, the Jane Ortner Artist Award from the Grammy Museum in 2016, and a National Board of Review Award for Best Actress in 2018. Gaga has also been recognized by the ||Council_of_Fashion_Designers_of_America|| (CFDA) with the Fashion Icon award. In 2019, she became the first woman to win an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award and a Grammy Award in one year for her contribution to A Star Is Born's soundtrack. At the 2020 MTV Video Music Awards, she was honored with the inaugural Tricon Award representing achievement in three (or more) fields of entertainment. Acknowledged by Billboard as the Greatest Pop Star in 2009, with honorable mention in 2010 and 2011, and Woman of the Year in 2015, Gaga has consecutively appeared on the magazine's Artists of the Year chart (scoring the definitive title in 2010), and ranked 11th on its Top Artists of the 2010s chart. She is the longest-reigning act of Billboard's ||Dance/Electronic_Albums|| chart with 211 weeks at number one, while The Fame (2008) holds the record for the most time on top in the chart's history, with 142 non-consecutive weeks. Gaga has also been included in several Forbes' power rankings, ranked fourth on VH1's Greatest Women in Music (2012), and was named by Time as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2010 and 2019. Her album Born This Way (2011) featured on Rolling Stone's 2020 revision of their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, while the song "Bad Romance" and its music video were among Rolling Stone's ||Rolling_Stone%27s_500_Greatest_Songs_of_All_Time|| and 100 Greatest Music Videos of All Time, respectively, in 2021. Gaga is one of ||List_of_best-selling_music_artists||, with estimated sales of 124 million records as of 2014, and has produced some of the ||List_of_best-selling_singles||. She has grossed more than $512.3 million in revenue from concert tours and residencies, becoming the fifth woman to pass the half-billion total as reported to Billboard Boxscore, while receiving the ||Pollstar|| for Pop Touring Artist of the Decade (2010s). She is the twelfth ||List_of_highest-certified_music_artists_in_the_United_States|| in the US, with 85.5 million equivalent units certified according to ||Recording_Industry_Association_of_America|| (RIAA), was the first woman to receive the Digital Diamond Award certification from RIAA, one of three artists with at least two Diamond certified songs ("Bad Romance" and "Poker Face"), and the first and only artist to have two songs pass seven million downloads ("Poker Face" and "Just Dance"). By the end of 2020, with "Just Dance", "Poker Face", "Bad Romance" and "Shallow", she became the first female artist to achieve four singles that sold at least 10 million copies globally.
