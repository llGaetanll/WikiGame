Such questions are often posed as problems to be studied or resolved. Some sources claim the term was coined by ||Pythagoras|| (c. 570 – c. 495 BCE); others dispute this story, arguing that Pythagoreans merely claimed use of a preexisting term. ||Philosophical_methodology|| include ||Socratic_questioning||, ||Socratic_method||, ||Dialectic||, and systematic presentation. Historically, philosophy encompassed all bodies of knowledge and a practitioner was known as a ||Philosopher||. From the time of ||Ancient_Greek|| philosopher ||Aristotle|| to the 19th century, "||Natural_philosophy||" encompassed ||Astronomy||, ||Medicine||, and ||Physics||. For example, ||Isaac_Newton||'s 1687 ||Philosophi%C3%A6_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica|| later became classified as a book of physics. In the 19th century, the growth of modern ||University|| led academic philosophy and other disciplines to ||Contemporary_philosophy|| and specialize. Since then, various areas of investigation that were traditionally part of philosophy have become separate academic disciplines, and namely the ||Social_sciences|| such as ||Psychology||, ||Sociology||, ||Linguistics||, and ||Economics||. Today, major subfields of academic philosophy include ||Metaphysics||, which is concerned with the fundamental nature of ||Existence|| and ||Reality||; ||Epistemology||, which studies the nature of ||Knowledge|| and ||Belief||; ||Ethics||, which is concerned with ||Value_(ethics)||; and ||Logic||, which studies the ||Rules_of_inference|| that allow one to derive ||Consequent|| from ||Truth|| ||Premises||. Other notable subfields include ||Philosophy_of_religion||, ||Philosophy_of_science||, ||Political_philosophy||, ||Aesthetics||, ||Philosophy_of_language||, and ||Philosophy_of_mind||. Contents Definitions Main article: ||Definitions_of_philosophy|| There is wide agreement that philosophy (from the ||Ancient_Greek|| φίλος, phílos: "love"; and σοφία, sophía: "wisdom") is characterized by various general features: it is a form of ||Rational|| inquiry, it aims to be systematic, and it tends to critically reflect on its own methods and presuppositions. But approaches that go beyond such vague characterizations to give a more interesting or profound definition are usually controversial. Often, they are only accepted by theorists belonging to a certain ||Philosophical_movement|| and are revisionistic in that many presumed parts of philosophy would not deserve the title "philosophy" if they were true. Before the modern age, the term was used in a very wide sense, which included the individual ||Science||, like ||Physics|| or ||Mathematics||, as its sub-disciplines, but the contemporary usage is more narrow. Some approaches argue that there is a set of essential features shared by all parts of philosophy while others see only weaker family resemblances or contend that it is merely an empty blanket term. Some definitions characterize philosophy in relation to its method, like pure reasoning. Others focus more on its topic, for example, as the study of the biggest patterns of the world as a whole or as the attempt to answer the big questions. Both approaches have the problem that they are usually either too wide, by including non-philosophical disciplines, or too narrow, by excluding some philosophical sub-disciplines. Many definitions of philosophy emphasize its intimate relation to science. In this sense, philosophy is sometimes understood as a proper science in its own right. Some ||Naturalism_(philosophy)|| approaches, for example, see philosophy as an empirical yet very abstract science that is concerned with very wide-ranging empirical patterns instead of particular observations. Some ||Phenomenology_(philosophy)||, on the other hand, characterize philosophy as the science of ||Essence||. Science-based definitions usually face the problem of explaining why philosophy in its long history has not made the type of ||Scientific_progress||. This problem is avoided by seeing philosophy as an immature or provisional science whose subdisciplines cease to be philosophy once they have fully developed. In this sense, philosophy is the midwife of the sciences. Other definitions focus more on the contrast between science and philosophy. A common theme among many such definitions is that philosophy is concerned with ||Meaning_(philosophy)||, ||Understanding||, or the clarification of language. According to one view, philosophy is ||Conceptual_analysis||, which involves finding the ||Necessary_and_sufficient_conditions|| for the application of concepts. Another defines philosophy as a linguistic therapy that aims at dispelling misunderstandings to which humans are susceptible due to the confusing structure of ||Natural_language||. One more approach holds that the main task of philosophy is to articulate the pre-ontological understanding of the world, which acts as a ||Condition_of_possibility|| of ||Experience||. Many other definitions of philosophy do not clearly fall into any of the aforementioned categories. An early approach already found in ||Ancient_Greek_philosophy|| and ||Ancient_Roman_philosophy|| is that philosophy is the spiritual practice of developing one's ||Reasoning|| ability. This practice is an expression of the philosopher's love of wisdom and has the aim of improving one's ||Well-being|| by leading a reflective life. A closely related approach identifies the development and articulation of ||Worldviews|| as the principal task of philosophy, i.e. to express how things on the grand scale hang together and which practical stance we should take towards them. Another definition characterizes philosophy as ||Thinking|| about thinking in order to emphasize its reflective nature. Historical overview In one general sense, philosophy is associated with ||Wisdom||, intellectual culture, and a search for knowledge. In this sense, all cultures and literate societies ask philosophical questions, such as "how are we to live" and "what is the nature of reality." A broad and impartial conception of philosophy, then, finds a reasoned inquiry into such matters as ||Reality||, ||Morality||, and life in all world civilizations. Western philosophy Main article: ||Western_philosophy||  Statue of ||Aristotle|| (384–322 BCE), a major figure of ancient Greek philosophy, in Aristotle's Park, ||Stagira||. ||Western_philosophy|| is the philosophical tradition of the ||Western_world||, dating back to ||Pre-Socratic_philosophy|| thinkers who were active in 6th-century ||Ancient_Greece|| (BCE), such as ||Thales|| ( 624 –  545 BCE) and ||Pythagoras|| (c. 570 – c. 495 BCE) who practiced a 'love of wisdom' (||Latin_language||: philosophia) and were also termed 'students of nature' (physiologoi). ||Western_philosophy|| can be divided into three eras: ||Ancient_Greek_philosophy|| (||Greco-Roman_world||). ||Medieval_philosophy|| (referring to Christian European thought). ||Modern_philosophy|| (beginning in the 17th century). Ancient era While our knowledge of the ancient era begins with ||Thales|| in the 6th century BCE, little is known about the philosophers who came before ||Socrates|| (commonly known as ||Pre-Socratic_philosophy||). The ancient era was dominated by ||Ancient_Greek_philosophy||. Most notable among the schools influenced by Socrates' teachings were ||Plato||, who founded the ||Platonic_Academy||, and his student ||Aristotle||, who founded the ||Peripatetic_school||. Other ancient philosophical traditions influenced by Socrates included ||Cynicism_(philosophy)||, ||Cyrenaics||, ||Stoicism||, and ||Academic_Skepticism||. Two other traditions were influenced by Socrates' contemporary, ||Democritus||: ||Pyrrhonism|| and ||Epicureanism||. Important topics covered by the Greeks included ||Metaphysics|| (with competing theories such as ||Atomism|| and ||Monism||), ||Cosmology||, the nature of the well-lived life (||Eudaimonia||), the ||Epistemology||, and the nature of reason (||Logos||). With the rise of the ||Roman_empire||, Greek philosophy was increasingly discussed in ||Latin|| by ||Ancient_Rome|| such as ||Cicero|| and ||Seneca_the_Younger|| (see ||Roman_philosophy||). Medieval era ||Medieval_philosophy|| (5th–16th centuries) took place during the period following the fall of the ||Western_Roman_Empire|| and was dominated by the rise of ||Christianity||; it hence reflects ||Judeo-Christian|| theological concerns while also retaining a continuity with Greco-Roman thought. Problems such as the existence and nature of ||God||, the nature of ||Faith|| and reason, metaphysics, and the ||Problem_of_evil|| were discussed in this period. Some key medieval thinkers include ||St._Augustine||, ||Thomas_Aquinas||, ||Boethius||, ||Anselm_of_Laon|| and ||Roger_Bacon||. Philosophy for these thinkers was viewed as an aid to ||Theology|| (ancilla theologiae), and hence they sought to align their philosophy with their interpretation of sacred scripture. This period saw the development of ||Scholasticism||, a text critical method developed in ||Medieval_universities|| based on close reading and disputation on key texts. The ||Renaissance|| period saw increasing focus on classic Greco-Roman thought and on a robust ||Humanism||. Modern era  A painting of the influential modern philosopher ||Immanuel_Kant|| (in the blue coat) with his friends. Other figures include ||Christian_Jakob_Kraus||, ||Johann_Georg_Hamann||, ||Theodor_Gottlieb_von_Hippel_the_Elder|| and ||Karl_Gottfried_Hagen||. ||Early_modern_philosophy|| in the Western world begins with thinkers such as ||Thomas_Hobbes|| and ||Ren%C3%A9_Descartes|| (1596–1650). Following the rise of natural science, ||Modern_philosophy|| was concerned with developing a secular and rational foundation for knowledge and moved away from traditional structures of authority such as religion, scholastic thought and the Church. Major modern philosophers include ||Spinoza||, ||Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz||, ||John_Locke||, ||George_Berkeley||, ||David_Hume||, and ||Immanuel_Kant||. ||19th-century_philosophy|| (sometimes called ||Late_modern_philosophy||) was influenced by the wider 18th-century movement termed "||The_Enlightenment||", and includes figures such as ||Hegel||, a key figure in ||German_idealism||; ||Kierkegaard||, who developed the foundations for ||Existentialism||; ||Nietzsche||, a famed anti-Christian; ||John_Stuart_Mill||, who promoted ||Utilitarianism||; ||Karl_Marx||, who developed the foundations for ||Communism||; and the American ||William_James||. The 20th century saw the split between ||Analytic_philosophy|| and ||Continental_philosophy||, as well as philosophical trends such as ||Phenomenology_(philosophy)||, ||Existentialism||, ||Logical_positivism||, ||Pragmatism|| and the ||Linguistic_turn|| (see ||Contemporary_philosophy||). Middle Eastern philosophy Main article: ||Middle_Eastern_philosophy|| Pre-Islamic philosophy The regions of the ||Fertile_Crescent||, ||Iran|| and ||Arabia|| are home to the earliest known philosophical wisdom literature. According to the ||Assyriology|| ||Marc_Van_de_Mieroop||, ||Babylonia|| philosophy was a highly developed system of thought with a unique approach to knowledge and a focus on writing, ||Lexicography||, divination, and law. It was also a ||Multilingualism|| intellectual culture, based on ||Sumerian_language|| and ||Akkadian_language||.  A page of The Maxims of Ptahhotep, traditionally attributed to the ||Vizier_(Ancient_Egypt)|| ||Ptahhotep|| (c. 2375–2350 BCE). Early ||Wisdom_literature|| from the Fertile Crescent was a genre that sought to instruct people on ethical action, practical living, and virtue through stories and proverbs. In ||Ancient_Egypt||, these texts were known as ||Sebayt|| ('teachings'), and they are central to our understandings of ||Ancient_Egyptian_philosophy||. The most well known of these texts is ||The_Maxims_of_Ptahhotep||. Theology and cosmology were central concerns in Egyptian thought. Perhaps the earliest form of a ||Monotheism|| ||Theology|| also emerged in Egypt, with the rise of the ||Atenism|| of ||Akhenaten|| (14th century BCE), which held that the solar creation deity ||Aten|| was the only god. This has been described as a "monotheistic revolution" by ||Egyptology|| ||Jan_Assmann||, though it also drew on previous developments in Egyptian thought, particularly the "New Solar Theology" based around ||Amun||. These theological developments also influenced the post-Amarna ||New_Kingdom_of_Egypt|| theology, which retained a focus on a single creative solar deity (though without outright rejection of other gods, which are now seen as manifestations of the main solar deity). This period also saw the development of the concept of the ||Ancient_Egyptian_conception_of_the_soul|| (soul) and its relation to god. ||Jewish_philosophy|| and ||Christian_philosophy|| are religious-philosophical traditions that developed both in the Middle East and in Europe, which both share certain early Judaic texts (mainly the ||Tanakh||) and monotheistic beliefs. Jewish thinkers such as the ||Geonim|| of the ||Talmudic_Academies_in_Babylonia|| and ||Maimonides|| engaged with Greek and Islamic philosophy. Later Jewish philosophy came under strong Western intellectual influences and includes the works of ||Moses_Mendelssohn|| who ushered in the ||Haskalah|| (the Jewish Enlightenment), ||Jewish_existentialism||, and ||Reform_Judaism||. The various traditions of ||Gnosticism||, which were influenced by both Greek and Abrahamic currents, originated around the first century and emphasized spiritual knowledge (||Gnosis||). Pre-Islamic ||Iranian_philosophy|| begins with the work of ||Zoroaster||, one of the first promoters of ||Monotheism|| and of the ||Dualistic_cosmology|| between good and evil. This dualistic cosmogony influenced later Iranian developments such as ||Manichaeism||, ||Mazdakism||, and ||Zurvanism||. Islamic philosophy See also: ||Islamic_philosophy|| An Iranian portrait of ||Avicenna|| on a Silver Vase. He was one of the most influential philosophers of the ||Islamic_Golden_Age||. ||Islamic_philosophy|| is the philosophical work originating in the ||Islamic_culture|| and is mostly done in ||Arabic||. It draws from the religion of Islam as well as from Greco-Roman philosophy. After the ||Muslim_conquests||, the ||Graeco-Arabic_translation_movement|| (mid-eighth to the late tenth century) resulted in the works of Greek philosophy becoming available in Arabic. ||Early_Islamic_philosophy|| developed the Greek philosophical traditions in new innovative directions. This intellectual work inaugurated what is known as the ||Islamic_Golden_Age||. The two main currents of early Islamic thought are ||Kalam||, which focuses on ||Islamic_theology||, and ||Falsafa||, which was based on ||Aristotelianism|| and ||Neoplatonism||. The work of Aristotle was very influential among philosophers such as ||Al-Kindi|| (9th century), ||Avicenna|| (980 – June 1037), and ||Averroes|| (12th century). Others such as ||Al-Ghazali|| were highly critical of the methods of the Islamic Aristotelians and saw their metaphysical ideas as heretical. Islamic thinkers like ||Ibn_al-Haytham|| and ||Al-Biruni|| also developed a ||Scientific_method||, experimental medicine, a theory of optics, and a legal philosophy. ||Ibn_Khaldun|| was an influential thinker in ||Philosophy_of_history||. Islamic thought also deeply influenced European intellectual developments, especially through the commentaries of Averroes on Aristotle. The ||Mongol_invasions_of_the_Levant|| and the ||Siege_of_Baghdad_(1258)|| in 1258 are often seen as marking the end of the Golden Age. Several schools of Islamic philosophy continued to flourish after the Golden Age, however, and include currents such as ||Illuminationist_philosophy||, ||Sufi_philosophy||, and ||Transcendent_theosophy||. The 19th- and 20th-century ||Arab_world|| saw the ||Nahda|| movement (literally meaning 'The Awakening'; also known as the 'Arab Renaissance'), which had a considerable influence on ||Contemporary_Islamic_philosophy||. Eastern philosophy Main article: ||Eastern_philosophy|| Indian philosophy Main article: ||Indian_philosophy||  ||Adi_Shankara|| is one of the most frequently studied ||Hindu|| philosophers. ||Indian_philosophy|| (||Sanskrit_language||: darśana, ||Literal_translation|| 'point of view', 'perspective') refers to the diverse philosophical traditions that emerged since the ancient times on the ||Indian_subcontinent||. Indian philosophical traditions share various key concepts and ideas, which are defined in different ways and accepted or rejected by the different traditions. These include concepts such as ||Dharma||, ||Karma||, ||Pramana||, ||Du%E1%B8%A5kha||, ||Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra|| and ||Moksha||. Some of the earliest surviving Indian philosophical texts are the ||Upanishads|| of the ||Vedic_period#Later_Vedic_period_(c._1000_–_c._600_BCE)|| (1000–500 BCE), which are considered to preserve the ideas of ||Historical_Vedic_religion||. Indian philosophical traditions are commonly grouped according to their relationship to the Vedas and the ideas contained in them. ||Jainism|| and ||Buddhism|| originated at the end of the ||Vedic_period||, while the various traditions grouped under ||Hinduism|| mostly emerged after the Vedic period as independent traditions. Hindus generally classify Indian philosophical traditions as either orthodox () or heterodox (nāstika) depending on whether they accept the authority of the ||Vedas|| and the theories of ||Brahman|| and found therein. The schools which align themselves with the thought of the Upanishads, the so-called "orthodox" or "||Hinduism||" traditions, are often classified into six ||Hindu_philosophy|| or philosophies:||Samkhya||, ||Yoga_(philosophy)||, ||Nyaya||, ||Vaisheshika||, ||M%C4%ABm%C4%81%E1%B9%83s%C4%81|| and ||Vedanta||. The doctrines of the Vedas and Upanishads were interpreted differently by these six schools of ||Hindu_philosophy||, with varying degrees of overlap. They represent a "collection of philosophical views that share a textual connection," according to Chadha (2015). They also reflect a tolerance for a diversity of philosophical interpretations within Hinduism while sharing the same foundation. Hindu philosophers of the six orthodox schools developed systems of epistemology (||Pramana||) and investigated topics such as metaphysics, ethics, psychology (||Gu%E1%B9%87a||), ||Hermeneutics||, and ||Soteriology|| within the framework of the Vedic knowledge, while presenting a diverse collection of interpretations. The commonly named six orthodox schools were the competing philosophical traditions of what has been called the "Hindu synthesis" of ||History_of_Hinduism||. There are also other schools of thought which are often seen as "Hindu", though not necessarily orthodox (since they may accept different scriptures as normative, such as the ||Tantras_(Hinduism)||), these include different schools of ||Shaivism|| such as ||Pashupata_Shaivism||, ||Shaiva_Siddhanta||, ||Kashmir_Shaivism|| (i.e. Trika, Kaula, etc.).  The parable of the blind men and the elephant illustrates the important Jain doctrine of ||Anekantavada||. The "Hindu" and "Orthodox" traditions are often contrasted with the "unorthodox" traditions (nāstika, literally "those who reject"), though this is a label that is not used by the "unorthodox" schools themselves. These traditions reject the Vedas as authoritative and often reject major concepts and ideas that are widely accepted by the orthodox schools (such as Ātman, Brahman, and ||Ishvara||). These unorthodox schools include Jainism (accepts ātman but rejects Īśvara, Vedas and Brahman), Buddhism (rejects all orthodox concepts except rebirth and karma), ||Charvaka|| (materialists who reject even rebirth and karma) and (known for their doctrine of fate). ||Jain_philosophy|| is one of the only two surviving "unorthodox" traditions (along with Buddhism). It generally accepts the concept of a permanent soul (||Jiva||) as one of the five (eternal, infinite categories that make up the substance of existence). The other four being ||Dharma||, ||Adharma||, ||Akasha|| ('space'), and ||Pudgala|| ('matter'). Jain thought holds that all existence is cyclic, eternal and uncreated. Some of the most important elements of Jain philosophy are the ||Karma_in_Jainism||, the doctrine of nonviolence (||Ahimsa_in_Jainism||) and the theory of "many-sidedness" or ||Anekantavada||. The ||Tattvartha_Sutra|| is the earliest known, most comprehensive and authoritative compilation of Jain philosophy. Buddhist philosophy Main article: ||Buddhist_philosophy||  Monks debating at ||Sera_monastery||, Tibet, 2013. According to Jan Westerhoff, "public debates constituted the most important and most visible forms of philosophical exchange" in ancient Indian intellectual life. Buddhist philosophy begins with the thought of ||Gautama_Buddha|| (||Floruit|| between 6th and 4th century BCE) and is preserved in the ||Early_Buddhist_Texts||. It originated in the Indian region of ||Magadha|| and later spread to the rest of the ||Indian_subcontinent||, ||East_Asia||, ||Tibet||, ||Central_Asia||, and ||Southeast_Asia||. In these regions, Buddhist thought developed into different philosophical traditions which used various languages (like ||Classical_Tibetan||, ||Classical_Chinese|| and ||Pali||). As such, Buddhist philosophy is a ||Transculturalism|| and international phenomenon. The dominant Buddhist philosophical traditions in ||East_Asian_Buddhism|| nations are mainly based on Indian ||Mahayana|| Buddhism. The ||Therav%C4%81da_Abhidhamma|| school is dominant in ||Southeast_Asia|| countries like ||Sri_Lanka||, ||Burma|| and ||Thailand||. Because ||Avidy%C4%81_(Buddhism)|| to the true nature of things is considered one of the roots of suffering (||Dukkha||), Buddhist philosophy is concerned with epistemology, metaphysics, ethics and psychology. Buddhist philosophical texts must also be understood within the context of ||Buddhist_meditation|| which are supposed to bring about certain cognitive shifts. Key innovative concepts include the ||Four_Noble_Truths|| as an analysis of dukkha, ||Impermanence|| (impermanence), and ||Anatta|| (non-self). After the death of the Buddha, various groups began to systematize his main teachings, eventually developing comprehensive philosophical systems termed ||Abhidharma||. Following the Abhidharma schools, Indian ||Mahayana|| philosophers such as ||Nagarjuna|| and ||Vasubandhu|| developed the theories of ('emptiness of all phenomena') and ||Yogachara#Vijñapti-mātra|| ('appearance only'), a form of phenomenology or ||Transcendental_idealism||. The ||Dign%C4%81ga|| school of ||Pramana|| ('means of knowledge') promoted a sophisticated form of ||Buddhist_logico-epistemology||. There were numerous schools, sub-schools, and traditions of Buddhist philosophy in ancient and medieval India. According to Oxford professor of Buddhist philosophy ||Jan_Westerhoff||, the major Indian schools from 300 BCE to 1000 CE were: the ||Mah%C4%81s%C4%81%E1%B9%83ghika|| tradition (now extinct), the ||Sthavira_nik%C4%81ya|| schools (such as ||Sarvastivada||, ||Vibhajyav%C4%81da|| and ||Pudgalavada||) and the ||Mahayana|| schools. Many of these traditions were also studied in other regions, like Central Asia and China, having been brought there by Buddhist missionaries. After the disappearance of Buddhism from India, some of these philosophical traditions continued to develop in the ||Tibetan_Buddhist||, ||East_Asian_Buddhist|| and ||Theravada_Buddhist|| traditions. East Asian philosophy Main articles: ||Chinese_philosophy||, ||Korean_philosophy||, ||Japanese_philosophy||, ||Vietnamese_philosophy||, and ||Eastern_philosophy||  Statue of the Neo-Confucian scholar ||Zhu_Xi|| at the ||White_Deer_Grotto_Academy|| in ||Mount_Lu||.  ||Kitaro_Nishida||, considered the founder of the Kyoto School of philosophical thought, c. 1943. East Asian philosophical thought began in ||History_of_China#Ancient_China||, and ||Chinese_philosophy|| begins during the ||Western_Zhou|| Dynasty and the following periods after its fall when the "||Hundred_Schools_of_Thought||" flourished (6th century to 221 BCE). This period was characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments and saw the rise of the major philosophical schools of China such as ||Confucianism|| (also known as Ruism), ||Legalism_(Chinese_philosophy)||, and ||Daoism|| as well as numerous other less influential schools like ||Mohism|| and ||School_of_Naturalists||. These philosophical traditions developed metaphysical, political and ethical theories such ||Tao||, ||Yin_and_yang||, ||Ren_(Confucianism)|| and ||Li_(Confucianism)||. These schools of thought further developed during the ||Han_dynasty|| (206 BCE – 220 CE) and ||Tang_dynasty|| (618–907 CE) eras, forming new philosophical movements like ||Xuanxue|| (also called Neo-Taoism), and ||Neo-Confucianism||. Neo-Confucianism was a syncretic philosophy, which incorporated the ideas of different Chinese philosophical traditions, including Buddhism and Taoism. Neo-Confucianism came to dominate the education system during the ||Song_dynasty|| (960–1297), and its ideas served as the philosophical basis of the ||Imperial_exams|| for the ||Scholar-officials||. Some of the most important Neo-Confucian thinkers are the Tang scholars ||Han_Yu|| and ||Li_Ao_(philosopher)|| as well as the Song thinkers ||Zhou_Dunyi|| (1017–1073) and ||Zhu_Xi|| (1130–1200). Zhu Xi compiled the Confucian canon, which consists of the ||Four_Books|| (the ||Great_Learning||, the ||Doctrine_of_the_Mean||, the ||Analects|| of Confucius, and the ||Mencius_(book)||). The Ming scholar ||Wang_Yangming|| (1472–1529) is a later but important philosopher of this tradition as well. Buddhism began arriving in China during the Han Dynasty, through a ||Silk_Road_transmission_of_Buddhism||, and through native influences developed distinct Chinese forms (such as Chan/||Zen||) which spread throughout the ||East_Asian_cultural_sphere||. Chinese culture was highly influential on the traditions of other East Asian states, and its philosophy directly influenced ||Korean_philosophy||, ||Vietnamese_philosophy|| and ||Japanese_philosophy||. During later Chinese dynasties like the ||Ming_Dynasty|| (1368–1644), as well as in the Korean ||Joseon_dynasty|| (1392–1897), a resurgent ||Neo-Confucianism|| led by thinkers such as ||Wang_Yangming|| (1472–1529) became the dominant school of thought and was promoted by the imperial state. In Japan, the ||Tokugawa_shogunate|| (1603–1867) was also strongly influenced by Confucian philosophy. Confucianism continues to influence the ideas and worldview of the nations of the ||East_Asian_cultural_sphere|| today. In the Modern era, Chinese thinkers incorporated ideas from Western philosophy. ||Chinese_Marxist_philosophy|| developed under the influence of ||Mao_Zedong||, while a Chinese pragmatism developed under ||Hu_Shih||. The old traditional philosophies also began to reassert themselves in the 20th century. For example, ||New_Confucianism||, led by figures such as ||Xiong_Shili||, has become quite influential. Likewise, ||Humanistic_Buddhism|| is a recent modernist Buddhist movement. Modern Japanese thought meanwhile developed under strong Western influences such as the study of Western Sciences (||Rangaku||) and the modernist ||Meirokusha|| intellectual society, which drew from European enlightenment thought and promoted liberal reforms as well as Western philosophies like Liberalism and Utilitarianism. Another trend in modern Japanese philosophy was the "National Studies" (||Kokugaku||) tradition. This intellectual trend sought to study and promote ancient Japanese thought and culture. Kokugaku thinkers such as ||Motoori_Norinaga|| sought to return to a pure Japanese tradition which they called ||Shinto|| that they saw as untainted by foreign elements. During the 20th century, the ||Kyoto_School||, an influential and unique Japanese philosophical school, developed from Western ||Phenomenology_(philosophy)|| and Medieval Japanese Buddhist philosophy such as that of ||Dogen||. African philosophy Main article: ||African_philosophy||  Painting of Zera Yacob from ||Claude_Sumner||'s Classical Ethiopian Philosophy. African philosophy is philosophy produced by ||African_people||, philosophy that presents African worldviews, ideas and themes, or philosophy that uses distinct African philosophical methods. Modern African thought has been occupied with ||Ethnophilosophy||, that is, defining the very meaning of African philosophy and its unique characteristics and what it means to be ||African_people||. During the 17th century, ||Ethiopian_philosophy|| developed a robust literary tradition as exemplified by ||Zera_Yacob_(philosopher)||. Another early African philosopher was ||Anton_Wilhelm_Amo|| (c. 1703–1759) who became a respected philosopher in Germany. Distinct African philosophical ideas include ||Ujamaa||, the ||Bantu_peoples_in_South_Africa|| idea of ||Bantu_Philosophy||, ||N%C3%A9gritude||, ||Pan-Africanism|| and ||Ubuntu_(philosophy)||. Contemporary African thought has also seen the development of Professional philosophy and of ||Africana_philosophy||, the philosophical literature of the ||African_diaspora|| which includes currents such as ||Black_existentialism|| by ||African-Americans||. Some modern African thinkers have been influenced by ||Marxism||, ||African-American_literature||, ||Critical_theory||, ||Critical_race_theory||, ||Postcolonialism|| and ||African_feminism||. Indigenous American philosophy Main article: ||Indigenous_American_philosophy||  A ||Tlamatini|| (Aztec philosopher) observing the stars, from the ||Codex_Mendoza||. ||Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas|| philosophical thought consists of a wide variety of beliefs and traditions among different American cultures. Among some of ||Native_Americans_in_the_United_States|| communities, there is a belief in a metaphysical principle called the '||Great_Spirit||' (||Siouan_languages||: ||Wakan_Tanka||; ||Algonquian_languages||: ||Gitche_Manitou||). Another widely shared concept was that of ||Orenda|| ('spiritual power'). According to Whiteley (1998), for the Native Americans, "mind is critically informed by transcendental experience (dreams, visions and so on) as well as by reason." The practices to access these transcendental experiences are termed ||Shamanism||. Another feature of the indigenous American worldviews was their extension of ethics to non-human animals and plants. In ||Mesoamerica||, ||Aztec_philosophy|| was an intellectual tradition developed by individuals called ||Tlamatini|| ('those who know something') and its ideas are preserved in various ||Aztec_codices|| and fragmentary texts. Some of these philosophers are known by name, such as ||Nezahualcoyotl_(tlatoani)||, ||Aquiauhtzin||, ||Xayacamach||, ||Tochihuitzin_coyolchiuhqui|| and Cuauhtencoztli. These authors were also poets and some of their work has survived in the original ||Nahuatl||. Aztec philosophers developed theories of metaphysics, epistemology, values, and aesthetics. Aztec ethics was focused on seeking tlamatiliztli ('knowledge', 'wisdom') which was based on moderation and balance in all actions as in the ||Nahuas|| proverb "the middle good is necessary." The Nahua worldview posited the concept of an ultimate universal energy or force called ('Dual Cosmic Energy') which sought a way to live in balance with a constantly changing, "slippery" world. The theory of ||Teotl|| can be seen as a form of ||Pantheism||. According to James Maffie, Nahua metaphysics posited that teotl is "a single, vital, dynamic, vivifying, eternally self-generating and self-conceiving as well as self-regenerating and self-reconceiving sacred energy or force." This force was seen as the all-encompassing life force of the universe and as the universe itself.  Depiction of ||Pachacuti|| worshipping ||Inti|| (god Sun) at ||Coricancha||, in the 17th century second chronicles of ||Mart%C3%ADn_de_Mur%C3%BAa||. Pachacuti was a major Incan ruler, author and poet. The ||Inca_civilization|| also had an elite class of philosopher-scholars termed the amawtakuna or amautas who were important in the ||Inca_education|| system as teachers of philosophy, theology, astronomy, poetry, law, music, morality and history. Young Inca nobles were educated in these disciplines at the state college of Yacha-huasi in ||Cusco||, where they also learned the art of the ||Quipu||. Incan philosophy (as well as the broader category of Andean thought) held that the universe is animated by a single dynamic life force (sometimes termed camaquen or camac, as well as upani and amaya). This singular force also arises as a set of dual complementary yet opposite forces. These “complementary opposites” are called ||Yanantin|| and ||Yanantin#Masintin||. They are expressed as various polarities or dualities (such as male–female, dark–light, life and death, above and below) which interdependently contribute to the harmonious whole that is the universe through the process of reciprocity and mutual exchange called ayni. The Inca worldview also included the belief in a ||Creator_deity|| (||Viracocha||) and ||Reincarnation||. Women in philosophy Main article: ||Women_in_philosophy||  ||Mary_Wollstonecraft|| (1759-1797) was an English writer and philosopher. Although men have generally dominated philosophical discourse, women philosophers have engaged in the discipline throughout history. ||Ancient_philosophy|| examples include ||Hipparchia_of_Maroneia|| (active c. 325 BCE) and ||Arete_of_Cyrene|| (active 5th–4th centuries BCE). Some women philosophers were accepted during the ||Medieval_philosophy|| and ||Modern_philosophy|| eras, but none became part of the ||Western_canon|| until the ||Contemporary_philosophy||, when many suggest that ||G.E.M._Anscombe||, ||Hannah_Arendt||, ||Simone_de_Beauvoir||, and ||Susanne_Langer|| entered the canon. In the early 1800s, some colleges and universities in the UK and the US began ||Mixed-sex_education#Higher-education_institutions||, producing more female academics. Nevertheless, ||U.S._Department_of_Education|| reports from the 1990s indicate that few women ended up in philosophy and that philosophy is one of the least gender-proportionate fields in the ||Humanities||, with women making up somewhere between 17% and 30% of philosophy faculty according to some studies. Philosophical progress Many philosophical debates that began in ancient times are still debated today. British philosopher ||Colin_McGinn|| claims that no ||Philosophical_progress|| has occurred during that interval. Australian philosopher ||David_Chalmers||, by contrast, sees progress in philosophy similar to that in science. Meanwhile, ||Talbot_Brewer||, professor of philosophy at ||University_of_Virginia||, argues that "progress" is the wrong standard by which to judge philosophical activity. Branches of philosophy Philosophical questions can be grouped into various branches. These groupings allow philosophers to focus on a set of similar topics and interact with other thinkers who are interested in the same questions. These divisions are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive. (A philosopher might specialize in ||Kant|| epistemology, or ||Plato|| aesthetics, or modern political philosophy). Furthermore, these philosophical inquiries sometimes overlap with each other and with other inquiries such as science, religion or mathematics. Aesthetics Main article: ||Aesthetics|| Aesthetics is the "critical reflection on art, culture and ||Nature||." It addresses the nature of ||Art||, ||Beauty|| and ||Taste_(sociology)||, enjoyment, emotional values, perception and the creation and appreciation of beauty. It is more precisely defined as the study of ||Senses|| or sensori-emotional values, sometimes called ||Judgment|| of ||Feeling|| and taste. Its major divisions are art theory, ||Literary_theory||, ||Film_theory|| and ||Music_theory||. An example from art theory is to discern the set of principles underlying the work of a particular artist or artistic movement such as the ||Cubist|| aesthetic. Ethics Main article: ||Ethics||  The ||Beijing|| ||Guozijian_(Beijing)|| was an intellectual center for Confucian ethics and classics during the ||Yuan_Dynasty||, ||Ming_Dynasty|| and ||Qing_Dynasty|| dynasties. Ethics, also known as moral philosophy, studies what constitutes good and bad ||Action_(philosophy)||, right and ||Wrong|| ||Values_(philosophy)||, and ||Good_and_evil||. Its primary investigations include exploring how to live a good life and identifying standards of ||Morality||. It also includes investigating whether or not there is a best way to live or a universal moral standard, and if so, how we come to learn about it. The main branches of ethics are ||Normative_ethics||, ||Meta-ethics|| and ||Applied_ethics||. The three main views in ethics about what constitute moral actions are: ||Consequentialism||, which judges actions based on their consequences. One such view is ||Utilitarianism||, which judges actions based on the net happiness (or pleasure) and/or lack of suffering (or pain) that they produce. ||Deontology||, which judges actions based on whether or not they are in accordance with one's moral duty. In the standard form defended by ||Immanuel_Kant||, deontology is concerned with whether or not a choice respects the moral agency of other people, regardless of its consequences. ||Virtue_ethics||, which judges actions based on the moral character of the agent who performs them and whether they conform to what an ideally virtuous agent would do. Epistemology Main article: ||Epistemology||  ||Dignaga|| founded a school of ||Buddhist_logic||. ||Epistemology|| is the branch of philosophy that studies ||Knowledge||. Epistemologists examine putative sources of knowledge, including ||Perception||, ||Reason||, ||Memory||, and ||Testimony#Philosophy||. They also investigate questions about the nature of ||Truth||, ||Belief||, ||Justification_(epistemology)||, and ||Reason||. ||Philosophical_skepticism||, which raises doubts about some or all claims to knowledge, has been a topic of interest throughout the history of philosophy. It arose early in ||Pre-Socratic_philosophy|| and became formalized with ||Pyrrho||, the founder of the ||Pyrrhonism||. It features prominently in the works of modern philosophers ||Ren%C3%A9_Descartes|| and ||David_Hume|| and has remained a central topic in contemporary epistemological debates. One of the most notable epistemological debates is between ||Empiricism|| and ||Rationalism||. Empiricism places emphasis on observational evidence via sensory experience as the source of knowledge. Empiricism is associated with ||A_posteriori_knowledge||, which is obtained through experience (such as ||Philosophy_of_science||). Rationalism places emphasis on reason as a source of knowledge. Rationalism is associated with ||A_priori_knowledge||, which is independent of experience (such as ||Logic|| and ||Mathematics||). One central debate in contemporary epistemology is about the conditions required for a ||Belief|| to constitute knowledge, which might include ||Truth|| and ||Justification_(epistemology)||. This debate was largely the result of attempts to solve the ||Gettier_problem||. Another common subject of contemporary debates is the ||Regress_argument||, which occurs when trying to offer proof or justification for any belief, statement, or proposition. The problem is that whatever the source of justification may be, that source must either be without justification (in which case it must be treated as an arbitrary ||Foundationalism|| for belief), or it must have some further justification (in which case justification must either be the result of ||Circular_reasoning||, as in ||Coherentism||, or the result of an ||Infinite_regress||, as in ||Infinitism||). Metaphysics Main article: ||Metaphysics||  The beginning of ||Metaphysics_(Aristotle)|| in an incunabulum decorated with hand-painted miniatures. Metaphysics is the study of the most general features of ||Reality||, such as ||Existence||, ||Time||, ||Object_(philosophy)|| and their ||Property_(philosophy)||, wholes and their parts, events, processes and ||Causality|| and the relationship between ||Mind|| and ||Human_body||. Metaphysics includes ||Cosmology||, the study of the ||World|| in its entirety and ||Ontology||, the study of ||Being||. A major point of debate is between ||Philosophical_realism||, which holds that there are entities that exist independently of their mental perception, and ||Idealism||, which holds that reality is mentally constructed or otherwise immaterial. Metaphysics deals with the topic of ||Personal_identity||. ||Essence|| is the set of attributes that make an object what it fundamentally is and without which it loses its identity, while ||Accident_(philosophy)|| is a property that the object has, without which the object can still retain its identity. ||Particular|| are objects that are said to exist in space and time, as opposed to ||Abstract_object||, such as numbers, and ||Universals||, which are properties held by multiple particulars, such as redness or a gender. The type of existence, if any, of universals and abstract objects is an issue of debate. Logic Main article: ||Logic|| ||Logic|| is the study of reasoning and argument. ||Deductive_reasoning|| is when, given certain premises, conclusions are ||Logical_consequence||. ||Rules_of_inference|| are used to infer conclusions such as, ||Modus_ponens||, where given “A” and “If A then B”, then “B” must be concluded. Because sound reasoning is an essential element of all sciences, social sciences and humanities disciplines, logic became a ||Formal_science||. Sub-fields include ||Mathematical_logic||, ||Philosophical_logic||, ||Modal_logic||, ||Computational_logic|| and ||Non-classical_logic||. A major question in the ||Philosophy_of_mathematics|| is whether mathematical entities are objective and discovered, called mathematical realism, or invented, called mathematical antirealism. Mind and language Main articles: ||Philosophy_of_language|| and ||Philosophy_of_mind|| ||Philosophy_of_language|| explores the nature, origins, and use of language. ||Philosophy_of_mind|| explores the nature of the ||Mind|| and its relationship to the body, as typified by disputes between ||Materialism|| and ||Dualism_(philosophy_of_mind)||. In recent years, this branch has become related to ||Cognitive_science||. Philosophy of science Main article: ||Philosophy_of_science|| The ||Philosophy_of_science|| explores the foundations, methods, history, implications and purpose of science. Many of its subdivisions correspond to specific branches of science. For example, ||Philosophy_of_biology|| deals specifically with the metaphysical, epistemological and ethical issues in the biomedical and life sciences. Political philosophy Main article: ||Political_philosophy||  ||Thomas_Hobbes||, best known for his ||Leviathan_(Hobbes_book)||, which expounded an influential formulation of ||Social_contract|| theory. Political philosophy is the study of ||Government|| and the relationship of individuals (or families and clans) to communities including the ||State_(polity)||. It includes questions about justice, law, property and the rights and obligations of the citizen. Political philosophy, ethics, and aesthetics are traditionally linked subjects, under the general heading of value theory as they involve a normative or evaluative aspect. Philosophy of religion Main article: ||Philosophy_of_religion|| Philosophy of religion deals with questions that involve ||Religion|| and religious ideas from a philosophically neutral perspective (as opposed to ||Theology|| which begins from religious convictions). Traditionally, religious questions were not seen as a separate field from philosophy proper, and the idea of a separate field only arose in the 19th century. Issues include the ||Existence_of_God||, the relationship between reason and ||Faith||, questions of ||Religious_epistemology||, the ||Relationship_between_religion_and_science||, how to interpret ||Religious_experiences||, questions about the possibility of an ||Afterlife||, the ||Problem_of_religious_language|| and the existence of ||Souls|| and responses to ||Religious_pluralism|| and diversity. Metaphilosophy Main article: ||Metaphilosophy|| Metaphilosophy explores the aims, boundaries and methods of philosophy. It is debated as to whether metaphilosophy is a subject that comes prior to philosophy or whether it is inherently part of philosophy. Other subdivisions In section thirteen of his ||Lives_and_Opinions_of_Eminent_Philosophers||, the oldest surviving history of philosophy (3rd century), ||Diogenes_La%C3%ABrtius|| presents a three-part division of ancient Greek philosophical inquiry: ||Science|| (i.e. physics, from ||Greek_language||: ta physika, ||Literal_translation|| 'things having to do with physis [nature]') was the study of the constitution and processes of transformation in the physical world. ||Ethics|| (i.e. ethics, from êthika, 'having to do with character, disposition, manners') was the study of goodness, right and wrong, justice and virtue. ||Metaphysics|| (i.e. logic, from logikós, 'of or pertaining to reason or speech') was the study of ||Existence||, causation, ||God||, ||Logic||, ||Universal_(metaphysics)||, and other abstract objects. (meta ta physika, 'after the ||Physics_(Aristotle)||') In Against the Logicians the ||Pyrrhonism|| philosopher ||Sextus_Empiricus|| detailed the variety of ways in which the ancient Greek philosophers had divided philosophy, noting that this three-part division was agreed to by Plato, Aristotle, Xenocrates, and the Stoics. The ||Academic_skepticism|| philosopher ||Cicero|| also followed this three-part division. This division is not obsolete, but has changed: natural philosophy has split into the various natural sciences, especially physics, ||Astronomy||, ||Chemistry||, ||Biology||, and ||Cosmology||; moral philosophy has birthed the ||Social_science||, while still including ||Value_theory|| (e.g. ethics, ||Aesthetics||, ||Political_philosophy||, etc.); and metaphysical philosophy has given way to formal sciences such as logic, ||Mathematics|| and ||Philosophy_of_science||, while still including epistemology, cosmology, etc. For example, ||Isaac_Newton||'s ||Philosophi%C3%A6_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica|| (1687), since classified as a book of physics, uses the term ||Natural_philosophy|| as it was understood at the time, encompassing disciplines such as ||Astronomy||, ||Medicine|| and ||Physics|| that later became associated with ||Science||. Applied and professional philosophy  ||Martin_Luther_King_Jr.|| Main article: ||Contemporary_philosophy#Outside_the_profession|| Some of those who study philosophy become professional philosophers, typically by working as ||Professor|| who teach, research and write in academic institutions. However, most students of academic philosophy later contribute to law, journalism, religion, sciences, politics, business, or various arts. For example, public figures who have degrees in philosophy include comedians ||Steve_Martin|| and ||Ricky_Gervais||, filmmaker ||Terrence_Malick||, ||Pope_John_Paul_II||, Wikipedia co-founder ||Larry_Sanger||, technology entrepreneur ||Peter_Thiel||, U.S. Supreme Court Justice ||Stephen_Breyer|| and US vice presidential candidate ||Carly_Fiorina||. ||Curtis_White_(author)|| has argued that philosophical tools are essential to humanities, sciences and social sciences. Recent efforts to avail the general public to the work and relevance of philosophers include the million-dollar ||Berggruen_Prize_for_Philosophy||, first awarded to ||Charles_Taylor_(philosopher)|| in 2016. Some philosophers argue that this professionalization has negatively affected the discipline.

From whence all who occupied themselves in the contemplation of nature were both considered and called wise men; and that name of theirs continued to the age of Pythagoras, who is reported to have gone to Phlius, as we find it stated by Heraclides Ponticus, a very learned man, and a pupil of Plato, and to have discoursed very learnedly and copiously on certain subjects with Leon, prince of the Phliasii; and when Leon, admiring his ingenuity and eloquence, asked him what art he particularly professed, his answer was, that he was acquainted with no art, but that he was a philosopher. Leon, surprised at the novelty of the name, inquired what he meant by the name of philosopher, and in what philosophers differed from other men; on which Pythagoras replied, “That the life of man seemed to him to resemble those games which were celebrated with the 166greatest possible variety of sports and the general concourse of all Greece. For as in those games there were some persons whose object was glory and the honor of a crown, to be attained by the performance of bodily exercises, so others were led thither by the gain of buying and selling, and mere views of profit; but there was likewise one class of persons, and they were by far the best, whose aim was neither applause nor profit, but who came merely as spectators through curiosity, to observe what was done, and to see in what manner things were carried on there. And thus, said he, we come from another life and nature unto this one, just as men come out of some other city, to some much frequented mart; some being slaves to glory, others to money; and there are some few who, taking no account of anything else, earnestly look into the nature of things; and these men call themselves studious of wisdom, that is, philosophers: and as there it is the most reputable occupation of all to be a looker-on without making any acquisition, so in life, the contemplating things, and acquainting one’s self with them, greatly exceeds every other pursuit of life.”  Cameron, Alister (1938).
