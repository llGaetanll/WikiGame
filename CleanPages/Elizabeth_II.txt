Elizabeth was born in ||Mayfair||, London, as the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York (later ||King_George_VI|| and ||Queen_Elizabeth_The_Queen_Mother||). Her father acceded to the throne in 1936 upon ||Abdication_of_Edward_VIII|| of his brother, ||King_Edward_VIII||, making Elizabeth the ||Heir_presumptive||. She was educated privately at home and began to undertake public duties during the ||Second_World_War||, serving in the ||Auxiliary_Territorial_Service||. In November 1947, she ||Wedding_of_Princess_Elizabeth_and_Philip_Mountbatten|| ||Philip_Mountbatten||, a former prince of ||Kingdom_of_Greece|| and ||Denmark||, and their marriage lasted 73 years until ||Death_and_funeral_of_Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh|| in 2021. They had four children: ||Charles,_Prince_of_Wales||; ||Anne,_Princess_Royal||; ||Prince_Andrew,_Duke_of_York||; and ||Prince_Edward,_Earl_of_Wessex||. When ||Death_and_state_funeral_of_George_VI|| in February 1952, Elizabeth—then 25 years old—became ||Queen_regnant|| of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the United Kingdom, ||Monarchy_of_Canada||, ||Monarchy_of_Australia||, ||Monarchy_of_New_Zealand||, ||Union_of_South_Africa||, ||Dominion_of_Pakistan||, and ||Dominion_of_Ceylon||, as well as ||Head_of_the_Commonwealth||. Elizabeth has reigned as a ||Constitutional_monarch|| through major political changes such as ||The_Troubles|| in Northern Ireland, ||Devolution_in_the_United_Kingdom||, the ||Decolonisation_of_Africa||, and the United Kingdom's ||Accession_of_the_United_Kingdom_to_the_European_Communities|| to the ||European_Communities|| and ||Brexit|| from the ||European_Union||. The number of ||List_of_states_headed_by_Elizabeth_II|| has varied over time as territories have gained independence, and as some realms ||Republics_in_the_Commonwealth_of_Nations||. Her many historic visits and meetings include a ||State_visit_by_Elizabeth_II_to_the_Republic_of_Ireland|| in 2011 and visits to or from five popes. Significant events have included ||Coronation_of_Elizabeth_II|| in 1953 and the celebrations of her ||Silver_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II||, ||Golden_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II||, ||Diamond_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II|| and ||Platinum_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II|| ||List_of_jubilees_of_British_monarchs|| in 1977, 2002, 2012 and 2022 respectively. Elizabeth is the longest-lived and ||List_of_monarchs_in_Britain_by_length_of_reign||, the ||List_of_longest-reigning_monarchs|| in history, the ||List_of_oldest_living_state_leaders|| and ||List_of_current_reigning_monarchs_by_length_of_reign||, and the ||Lists_of_state_leaders_by_age|| and ||List_of_current_state_leaders_by_date_of_assumption_of_office||. Elizabeth has occasionally faced ||Republicanism_in_the_United_Kingdom|| and press criticism of the ||British_royal_family||, particularly after the breakdown of her children's marriages, her ||Annus_horribilis#Elizabeth_II|| in 1992, and the ||Death_of_Diana,_Princess_of_Wales|| of her former daughter-in-law ||Diana,_Princess_of_Wales||. However, support for the monarchy in the United Kingdom has been and remains consistently high, as does her personal popularity. Contents Early life  On the ||List_of_covers_of_Time_magazine_(1920s)#1929|| of ||Time_(magazine)||, April 1929 Elizabeth was born at 02:40 (||GMT||) on 21 April 1926, during the reign of her paternal grandfather, ||King_George_V||. Her father, the Duke of York (later ||King_George_VI||), was the second son of the King. Her mother, the Duchess of York (later ||Queen_Elizabeth_The_Queen_Mother||), was the youngest daughter of Scottish aristocrat ||Claude_Bowes-Lyon,_14th_Earl_of_Strathmore_and_Kinghorne||. She was delivered by ||Caesarean_section|| at her maternal grandfather's London house: 17 ||Bruton_Street||, Mayfair. She was ||Baptised|| by the ||Anglican|| ||Archbishop_of_York||, ||Cosmo_Gordon_Lang||, in the private chapel of ||Buckingham_Palace|| on 29 May, and named Elizabeth after her mother; Alexandra after ||Alexandra_of_Denmark||, who had died six months earlier; and Mary after ||Mary_of_Teck||. Called "Lilibet" by her close family, based on what she called herself at first, she was cherished by her grandfather, George V, whom she affectionately called "Grandpa England", and during his serious illness in 1929 her regular visits were credited in the popular press and by later biographers with raising his spirits and aiding his recovery.  Portrait by ||Philip_de_L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3||, 1933 Elizabeth's only sibling, ||Princess_Margaret||, was born in 1930. The two princesses were educated at home under the supervision of their mother and their ||Governess||, ||Marion_Crawford||. Lessons concentrated on history, language, literature, and music. Crawford published a biography of Elizabeth and Margaret's childhood years entitled ||The_Little_Princesses|| in 1950, much to the dismay of the royal family. The book describes Elizabeth's love of horses and dogs, her orderliness, and her attitude of responsibility. Others echoed such observations: ||Winston_Churchill|| described Elizabeth when she was two as "a character. She has an air of authority and reflectiveness astonishing in an infant." Her cousin ||Margaret_Rhodes|| described her as "a jolly little girl, but fundamentally sensible and well-behaved". Heir presumptive During her grandfather's reign, Elizabeth was third in the ||Line_of_succession_to_the_British_throne||, behind her uncle ||Edward_VIII|| and her father. Although her birth generated public interest, she was not expected to become queen, as Edward was still young and likely to marry and have children of his own, who would precede Elizabeth in the line of succession. When her grandfather died in 1936 and her uncle succeeded as Edward VIII, she became second in line to the throne, after her father. Later that year, ||Abdication_of_Edward_VIII||, after his proposed marriage to divorced ||Socialite|| ||Wallis_Simpson|| provoked a constitutional crisis. Consequently, Elizabeth's father became king, taking the ||Regnal_name|| ||George_VI||. Since Elizabeth had no brothers, she became ||Heir_presumptive||. If her parents had had a later son, he would have been ||Heir_apparent|| and above her in the line of succession, which was determined by ||Male-preference_primogeniture|| at the time. Elizabeth received private tuition in constitutional history from ||Henry_Marten_(educator)||, ||List_of_Provosts_of_Eton_College|| of ||Eton_College||, and learned French from a succession of native-speaking governesses. A ||Girl_Guides|| company, the ||Girlguiding_London_and_South_East_England#1st_Buckingham_Palace_Company||, was formed specifically so she could socialise with girls her own age. Later, she was enrolled as a ||Ranger_(Girl_Guide)||. In 1939, Elizabeth's parents ||1939_royal_tour_of_Canada|| and the United States. As in 1927, when they had ||Royal_visits_to_Australia#1927|| and New Zealand, Elizabeth remained in Britain, since her father thought her too young to undertake public tours. She "looked tearful" as her parents departed. They corresponded regularly, and she and her parents made the first royal ||Transatlantic_telephone|| call on 18 May. Second World War  In ||Auxiliary_Territorial_Service|| uniform, April 1945 In September 1939, Britain entered the ||Second_World_War||. ||Douglas_Hogg,_1st_Viscount_Hailsham|| suggested that Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret should be ||Evacuations_of_civilians_in_Britain_during_World_War_II|| to Canada to avoid the frequent ||Aerial_bombing_of_cities|| of London by the ||Luftwaffe||. This was rejected by their mother, who declared, "The children won't go without me. I won't leave without the King. And the King will never leave." The princesses stayed at ||Balmoral_Castle||, Scotland, until Christmas 1939, when they moved to ||Sandringham_House||, Norfolk. From February to May 1940, they lived at ||Royal_Lodge||, Windsor, until moving to ||Windsor_Castle||, where they lived for most of the next five years. At Windsor, the princesses staged ||Pantomime|| at Christmas in aid of the Queen's Wool Fund, which bought yarn to knit into military garments. In 1940, the 14-year-old Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast during the ||BBC||'s ||Children%27s_Hour||, addressing other children who had been evacuated from the cities. She stated: "We are trying to do all we can to help our gallant sailors, soldiers, and airmen, and we are trying, too, to bear our own share of the danger and sadness of war. We know, every one of us, that in the end all will be well." In 1943, Elizabeth undertook her first solo public appearance on a visit to the ||Grenadier_Guards||, of which she had been appointed colonel the previous year. As she approached her 18th birthday, parliament changed the law so she could act as one of five ||Counsellors_of_State|| in the event of her father's incapacity or absence abroad, such as his visit to Italy in July 1944. In February 1945, she was appointed as an honorary ||Auxiliary_Territorial_Service#Ranks|| in the ||Auxiliary_Territorial_Service|| with the ||Service_number|| of 230873. She trained as a driver and mechanic and was given the rank of honorary junior commander (female equivalent of ||Captain_(British_Army_and_Royal_Marines)|| at the time) five months later.  Elizabeth (far left) on the balcony of ||Buckingham_Palace|| with her family and ||Winston_Churchill|| on 8 May 1945, ||Victory_in_Europe_Day|| At the end of the war in Europe, on ||Victory_in_Europe_Day||, Elizabeth and Margaret mingled incognito with the celebrating crowds in the streets of London. Elizabeth later said in a rare interview, "We asked my parents if we could go out and see for ourselves. I remember we were terrified of being recognised ... I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down ||Whitehall||, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief." During the war, plans were drawn up to quell ||Welsh_nationalism|| by affiliating Elizabeth more closely with Wales. Proposals, such as appointing her Constable of ||Caernarfon_Castle|| or a patron of ||Urdd_Gobaith_Cymru|| (the Welsh League of Youth), were abandoned for several reasons, including fear of associating Elizabeth with ||Conscientious_objector|| in the Urdd at a time when Britain was at war. Welsh politicians suggested she be made ||Princess_of_Wales|| on her 18th birthday. ||Home_Secretary|| ||Herbert_Morrison|| supported the idea, but the King rejected it because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent. In 1946, she was inducted into the ||Gorsedd|| of ||Bard|| at the ||National_Eisteddfod_of_Wales||. Princess Elizabeth went on her first overseas tour in 1947, accompanying her parents through southern Africa. During the tour, in a broadcast to the ||British_Commonwealth|| on her 21st birthday, she made the following pledge: "I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong." The speech was written by ||Dermot_Morrah||, a journalist for ||The_Times||. Marriage Main article: ||Wedding_of_Princess_Elizabeth_and_Philip_Mountbatten|| Elizabeth met her future husband, ||Prince_Philip_of_Greece_and_Denmark||, in 1934 and 1937. They were ||Cousin#Cousin_chart|| through ||King_Christian_IX_of_Denmark|| and third cousins through ||Queen_Victoria||. After another meeting at the ||Britannia_Royal_Naval_College|| in ||Dartmouth,_Devon|| in July 1939, Elizabeth—though only 13 years old—said she fell in love with Philip, and they began to exchange letters. She was 21 when their engagement was officially announced on 9 July 1947.  Elizabeth and ||Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh||, 1950 The engagement was not without controversy; Philip had no financial standing, was foreign-born (though a British subject who had served in the ||Royal_Navy|| throughout the Second World War), and had sisters who had married German noblemen with ||Nazi|| links. Marion Crawford wrote, "Some of the King's advisors did not think him good enough for her. He was a prince without a home or kingdom. Some of the papers played long and loud tunes on the string of Philip's foreign origin." Later biographies reported Elizabeth's mother had reservations about the union initially, and teased Philip as "||List_of_terms_used_for_Germans#Hun_(pejorative)||". In later life, however, the Queen Mother told biographer ||Tim_Heald|| that Philip was "an English gentleman". Before the marriage, Philip renounced his Greek and Danish titles, officially converted from ||Greek_Orthodoxy|| to ||Anglicanism||, and adopted the style Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten, taking ||Mountbatten||. Just before the wedding, he was created ||Duke_of_Edinburgh|| and granted the style His Royal Highness. Elizabeth and Philip were married on 20 November 1947 at ||Westminster_Abbey||. They received 2,500 wedding gifts from around the world. Because Britain had not yet completely recovered from the devastation of the war, Elizabeth required ||Rationing_in_the_United_Kingdom|| to buy the material for ||Wedding_dress_of_Princess_Elizabeth||, which was designed by ||Norman_Hartnell||. In post-war Britain, it was not acceptable for Philip's German relations, including his three surviving sisters, to be invited to the wedding. The Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII, was not invited either.  Princess Elizabeth with her son ||Prince_Charles||, 1948 Elizabeth gave birth to her first child, ||Prince_Charles||, on 14 November 1948. One month earlier, the King had issued ||Letters_patent|| allowing her children to use the style and title of a royal prince or princess, to which they otherwise would not have been entitled as their father was no longer a royal prince. A second child, ||Princess_Anne||, was born in 1950. Following their wedding, the couple leased ||Windlesham_Moor||, near ||Windsor_Castle||, until July 1949, when they took up residence at ||Clarence_House|| in London. At various times between 1949 and 1951, the Duke of Edinburgh was stationed in the British ||Crown_Colony_of_Malta|| as a serving Royal Navy officer. He and Elizabeth lived intermittently in Malta for several months at a time in the hamlet of ||Gwardaman%C4%A1a||, at ||Villa_Guardamangia||, the rented home of Philip's uncle, ||Lord_Mountbatten||. The children remained in Britain. Reign Accession and coronation Main article: ||Coronation_of_Elizabeth_II||  Coronation of Elizabeth II, 1953  ||Coronation_of_Elizabeth_II|| portrait of Elizabeth II with ||Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh||, 1953 During 1951, George VI's health declined, and Elizabeth frequently stood in for him at public events. When she toured Canada and visited President ||Harry_S._Truman|| in Washington, D.C., in October 1951, her private secretary, ||Martin_Charteris||, carried a draft accession declaration in case the King died while she was on tour. In early 1952, Elizabeth and Philip set out for a tour of Australia and New Zealand by way of Kenya. On 6 February 1952, they had just returned to their Kenyan home, ||Sagana_Lodge||, after a night spent at ||Treetops_Hotel||, when word arrived of the death of the King and consequently Elizabeth's immediate accession to the throne. Philip broke the news to the new queen. She chose to retain Elizabeth as her ||Regnal_name||; thus she was called Elizabeth II, which annoyed many Scots, as she was the first Elizabeth to rule in Scotland. She was ||Proclamation_of_accession_of_Elizabeth_II|| throughout her realms and the royal party hastily returned to the United Kingdom. She and the Duke of Edinburgh moved into ||Buckingham_Palace||. With Elizabeth's accession, it seemed probable the ||Royal_house|| would bear the Duke of Edinburgh's name, in line with the custom of a wife taking her husband's surname on marriage. The Duke's uncle, Lord Mountbatten, advocated the name House of Mountbatten. Philip suggested House of Edinburgh, after his ducal title. The British Prime Minister, ||Winston_Churchill||, and Elizabeth's grandmother, ||Mary_of_Teck||, favoured the retention of the ||House_of_Windsor||, and so on 9 April 1952 Elizabeth issued a declaration that Windsor would continue to be the name of the royal house. The Duke complained, "I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children." In 1960, after the death of Queen Mary in 1953 and the resignation of Churchill in 1955, the surname ||Mountbatten-Windsor|| was adopted for Philip and Elizabeth's male-line descendants who do not carry royal titles. Amid preparations for the coronation, Princess Margaret told her sister she wished to marry ||Peter_Townsend_(RAF_officer)||, a divorcé‚ 16 years Margaret's senior, with two sons from his previous marriage. The Queen asked them to wait for a year; in the words of Charteris, "the Queen was naturally sympathetic towards the Princess, but I think she thought—she hoped—given time, the affair would peter out." Senior politicians were against the match and the ||Church_of_England|| did not permit remarriage after divorce. If Margaret had contracted a ||Civil_marriage||, she would have been expected to renounce her right of succession. Margaret decided to abandon her plans with Townsend. Despite the death of Queen Mary on 24 March, the ||Coronation_of_Elizabeth_II|| went ahead as planned, as Mary had asked before she died. The ceremony in ||Westminster_Abbey||, with the exception of the ||Anointing|| and ||Eucharist||, was televised for the first time. ||Coronation_gown_of_Elizabeth_II|| was embroidered on her instructions with the floral emblems of Commonwealth countries. Continuing evolution of the Commonwealth Further information: ||Commonwealth_realm#From_the_accession_of_Elizabeth_II||  Elizabeth's realms (light red and pink) and their territories and ||Protectorate|| (dark red) at the beginning of her reign in 1952 From Elizabeth's birth onwards, the ||British_Empire|| continued its transformation into the ||Commonwealth_of_Nations||. By the time of her accession in 1952, her role as head of multiple independent states was already established. In 1953, the Queen and her husband embarked on a seven-month round-the-world tour, visiting 13 countries and covering more than 40,000 miles (64,000 kilometres) by land, sea and air. She became the first reigning ||Monarch_of_Australia|| and ||Monarchy_of_New_Zealand|| to visit those nations. During the tour, crowds were immense; three-quarters of the population of Australia were estimated to have seen her. Throughout her reign, the Queen has made hundreds of ||List_of_state_visits_made_by_Elizabeth_II|| to other countries and ||List_of_Commonwealth_visits_made_by_Elizabeth_II||; she is the most widely travelled head of state. In 1956, the British and French prime ministers, Sir ||Anthony_Eden|| and ||Guy_Mollet||, discussed the possibility of France joining the Commonwealth. The proposal was never accepted and the following year France signed the ||Treaty_of_Rome||, which established the ||European_Economic_Community||, the precursor to the ||European_Union||. In November 1956, Britain and France ||Suez_Crisis|| in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to capture the ||Suez_Canal||. ||Lord_Mountbatten|| said the Queen was opposed to the invasion, though Eden denied it. Eden resigned two months later.  Elizabeth II and Commonwealth leaders at the 1960 ||Commonwealth_Prime_Ministers%27_Conference|| The absence of a formal mechanism within the ||Conservative_Party_(UK)|| for choosing a leader meant that, following Eden's resignation, it fell to the Queen to decide whom to ||Kissing_hands||. Eden recommended she consult ||Robert_Gascoyne-Cecil,_5th_Marquess_of_Salisbury||, the ||Lord_President_of_the_Council||. Lord Salisbury and ||Lord_Kilmuir||, the ||Lord_Chancellor||, consulted the ||British_Cabinet||, Churchill, and the Chairman of the backbench ||1922_Committee||, resulting in the Queen appointing their recommended candidate: ||Harold_Macmillan||. The Suez crisis and the choice of Eden's successor led, in 1957, to the first major personal criticism of the Queen. In a magazine, which he owned and edited, ||John_Grigg_(writer)|| accused her of being "out of touch". Altrincham was denounced by public figures and slapped by a member of the public appalled by his comments. Six years later, in 1963, Macmillan resigned and advised the Queen to appoint ||Alec_Douglas-Home|| as prime minister, advice she followed. The Queen again came under criticism for appointing the prime minister on the advice of a small number of ministers or a single minister. In 1965, the Conservatives adopted a formal mechanism for electing a leader, thus relieving her of involvement. ||Wikisource|| has original text related to this article: In 1957, she made a state visit to the United States, where she addressed the ||United_Nations_General_Assembly|| on behalf of the Commonwealth. On the same tour, she opened the ||23rd_Canadian_Parliament||, becoming the first ||Monarch_of_Canada|| to open a parliamentary session. Two years later, solely in her capacity as Queen of Canada, she revisited the United States and toured Canada. In 1961, she toured ||Cyprus||, India, Pakistan, ||Kingdom_of_Nepal||, and ||Imperial_State_of_Iran||. On a visit to Ghana the same year, she dismissed fears for her safety, even though her host, ||List_of_heads_of_state_of_Ghana|| ||Kwame_Nkrumah||, who had replaced her as head of state, was a target for assassins. Harold Macmillan wrote, "The Queen has been absolutely determined all through ... She is impatient of the attitude towards her to treat her as ... a film star ... She has indeed '||Speech_to_the_Troops_at_Tilbury||' ... She loves her duty and means to be a Queen." Before her tour through parts of Quebec in 1964, the press reported extremists within the ||Quebec_sovereignty_movement|| were plotting Elizabeth's assassination. No attempt was made, but a riot did break out while she was in Montreal; the Queen's "calmness and courage in the face of the violence" was noted. Elizabeth's pregnancies with Princes ||Prince_Andrew,_Duke_of_York|| and ||Prince_Edward,_Earl_of_Wessex||, in 1959 and 1963, mark the only times she has not performed the ||State_Opening_of_Parliament|| during her reign. In addition to performing traditional ceremonies, she also instituted new practices. Her first royal walkabout, meeting ordinary members of the public, took place during a tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1970. Acceleration of decolonisation  In ||Queensland||, Australia, 1970 The 1960s and 1970s saw an acceleration in the ||Decolonisation|| of Africa and the ||Caribbean||. Over 20 countries gained independence from Britain as part of a planned transition to self-government. In 1965, however, the ||Rhodesia|| Prime Minister, ||Ian_Smith||, in opposition to moves towards majority rule, ||Rhodesia%27s_Unilateral_Declaration_of_Independence|| while expressing "loyalty and devotion" to Elizabeth, declaring her "||Queen_of_Rhodesia||". Although the Queen formally dismissed him, and the international community applied sanctions against Rhodesia, his regime survived for over a decade. As Britain's ties to its former empire weakened, the British government sought entry to the European Community, a goal it ||Accession_of_the_United_Kingdom_to_the_European_Communities||. In February 1974, the British Prime Minister, ||Edward_Heath||, advised the Queen to call a ||February_1974_United_Kingdom_general_election|| in the middle of her tour of the ||Austronesia|| ||Pacific_Rim||, requiring her to fly back to Britain. The election resulted in a hung parliament; Heath's Conservatives were not the largest party, but could stay in office if they formed a coalition with the ||Liberal_Party_(UK)||. Heath only resigned when discussions on forming a coalition foundered, after which the Queen asked the ||Leader_of_the_Opposition_(United_Kingdom)||, ||Labour_Party_(UK)|| ||Harold_Wilson||, to form a government. A year later, at the height of the ||1975_Australian_constitutional_crisis||, the Australian Prime Minister, ||Gough_Whitlam||, was dismissed from his post by ||Governor-General_of_Australia|| Sir ||John_Kerr_(governor-general)||, after the Opposition-controlled ||Australian_Senate|| rejected Whitlam's budget proposals. As Whitlam had a majority in the ||House_of_Representatives_(Australia)||, ||Speaker_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives|| ||Gordon_Scholes|| appealed to the Queen to reverse Kerr's decision. She declined, saying she would not interfere in decisions reserved by the ||Constitution_of_Australia|| for the Governor-General. The crisis fuelled ||Australian_republicanism||. Silver Jubilee  ||3rd_G7_summit||, members of the royal family and Elizabeth (centre), London, 1977 In 1977, Elizabeth marked the ||Silver_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II|| of her accession. Parties and events took place throughout the Commonwealth, many coinciding with ||List_of_events_during_the_Silver_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II||. The celebrations re-affirmed the Queen's popularity, despite virtually coincident negative press coverage of Princess Margaret's separation from her husband, ||Lord_Snowdon||. In 1978, the Queen endured a state visit to the United Kingdom by Romania's communist leader, ||Nicolae_Ceau%C8%99escu||, and his wife, ||Elena_Ceau%C8%99escu||, though privately she thought they had "blood on their hands". The following year brought two blows: one was the unmasking of ||Anthony_Blunt||, former ||Surveyor_of_the_Queen%27s_Pictures||, as a communist spy; the other was the assassination of her relative and in-law Lord Mountbatten by the ||Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army||. According to ||Paul_Martin_Sr.||, by the end of the 1970s the Queen was worried the Crown "had little meaning for" ||Pierre_Trudeau||, the ||Canadian_prime_minister||. ||Tony_Benn|| said the Queen found Trudeau "rather disappointing". Trudeau's supposed republicanism seemed to be confirmed by his antics, such as sliding down banisters at Buckingham Palace and pirouetting behind the Queen's back in 1977, and the removal of various ||Canadian_royal_symbols|| during his term of office. In 1980, Canadian politicians sent to London to discuss the ||Patriation|| of the ||Canadian_constitution|| found the Queen "better informed ... than any of the British politicians or bureaucrats". She was particularly interested after the failure of Bill C-60, which would have affected her role as head of state. Patriation removed the role of the ||British_parliament|| from the Canadian constitution, but the monarchy was retained. Trudeau said in his memoirs that the Queen favoured his attempt to reform the constitution and that he was impressed by "the grace she displayed in public" and "the wisdom she showed in private". Press scrutiny and Thatcher premiership  Elizabeth riding ||Burmese_(horse)|| at the 1986 ||Trooping_the_Colour|| ceremony During the 1981 ||Trooping_the_Colour|| ceremony, six weeks before the ||Wedding_of_Prince_Charles_and_Lady_Diana_Spencer||, six shots were fired at the Queen from close range as she rode down ||The_Mall,_London||, on her horse, ||Burmese_(horse)||. Police later discovered the shots were blanks. The 17-year-old assailant, ||Marcus_Sarjeant||, was sentenced to five years in prison and released after three. The Queen's composure and skill in controlling her mount were widely praised. Months later, in October, the Queen was the subject of another attack while on a visit to ||Dunedin||, New Zealand. ||New_Zealand_Security_Intelligence_Service|| documents, declassified in 2018, revealed that 17-year-old ||Christopher_John_Lewis|| fired a shot with a from the fifth floor of a building overlooking the parade, but missed. Lewis was arrested, but never charged with attempted murder or ||Treason||, and sentenced to three years in jail for unlawful possession and discharge of a firearm. Two years into his sentence, he attempted to escape a psychiatric hospital in order to assassinate Charles, who was visiting the country with ||Diana,_Princess_of_Wales|| and their son ||Prince_William||.  The Queen and ||Ronald_Reagan|| riding at Windsor, June 1982 From April to September 1982, the Queen's son, Prince Andrew, served with British forces in the ||Falklands_War||, for which she reportedly felt anxiety and pride. On 9 July, she awoke in her bedroom at Buckingham Palace to find an intruder, ||Michael_Fagan_incident||, in the room with her. In a serious lapse of security, assistance only arrived after two calls to the Palace police switchboard. After hosting US President ||Ronald_Reagan|| at Windsor Castle in 1982 and visiting ||Rancho_del_Cielo|| in 1983, the Queen was angered when his administration ordered the ||United_States_invasion_of_Grenada||, one of her Caribbean realms, without informing her. Intense media interest in the opinions and private lives of the royal family during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, not all of which were entirely true. As ||Kelvin_MacKenzie||, editor of ||The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)||, told his staff: "Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not true—so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards." Newspaper editor ||Donald_Trelford|| wrote in ||The_Observer|| of 21 September 1986: "The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of ... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not." It was reported, most notably in ||The_Sunday_Times|| of 20 July 1986, that the Queen was worried that ||Margaret_Thatcher||'s ||Thatcherism#economicposition|| fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, ||1981_England_riots||, the violence of a ||UK_miners%27_strike_(1984%E2%80%9385)||, and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the ||Apartheid|| regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide ||Michael_Shea_(diplomat)|| and ||Commonwealth_Secretary-General|| ||Shridath_Ramphal||, but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation. Thatcher reputedly said the Queen would vote for the ||Social_Democratic_Party_(UK)||—Thatcher's political opponents. Thatcher's biographer, ||John_Campbell_(biographer)||, claimed "the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making". Belying reports of acrimony between them, Thatcher later conveyed her personal admiration for the Queen, and the Queen gave two honours in her personal gift—membership in the ||Order_of_Merit|| and the ||Order_of_the_Garter||—to Thatcher after her replacement as prime minister by ||John_Major||. ||Brian_Mulroney||, Canadian prime minister between 1984 and 1993, said Elizabeth was a "behind the scenes force" in ending apartheid. In 1986, the Queen paid a six-day state visit to China, becoming the first British monarch to visit the country. The tour included the ||Forbidden_City||, the ||Great_Wall_of_China||, and the ||Terracotta_Warriors||. The visit also signified the acceptance of both countries that sovereignty over Hong Kong would be transferred from the United Kingdom to China in 1997. By the end of the 1980s, the Queen had become the target of satire. The involvement of younger members of the royal family in the charity game show ||It%27s_a_Royal_Knockout|| in 1987 was ridiculed. In Canada, Elizabeth publicly supported politically divisive ||Meech_Lake_Accord||, prompting criticism from opponents of the proposed changes, including Pierre Trudeau. The same year, the elected Fijian government was deposed in ||1987_Fijian_coups_d%27%C3%A9tat||. As ||Monarch_of_Fiji||, Elizabeth supported the attempts of ||Governor-General_of_Fiji|| Ratu Sir ||Penaia_Ganilau|| to assert executive power and negotiate a settlement. Coup leader ||Sitiveni_Rabuka|| deposed Ganilau and declared Fiji a republic. Turbulent 1990s and annus horribilis In 1991, in the wake of coalition victory in the ||Gulf_War||, the Queen became the first British monarch to address a ||Joint_session_of_the_United_States_Congress|| of the ||United_States_Congress||.  Philip and Elizabeth in Germany, October 1992 In a speech on 24 November 1992, to mark her ||Ruby_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II|| on the throne, Elizabeth called 1992 her ||Annus_horribilis|| ('horrible year'). Republican feeling in Britain had risen because of press estimates of the Queen's private wealth—which were contradicted by the Palace—and reports of affairs and strained marriages among her extended family. In March, her second son, Prince Andrew, and his wife, ||Sarah,_Duchess_of_York||, separated, and Mauritius removed Elizabeth as ||Queen_of_Mauritius||; in April, her daughter, Princess Anne, divorced Captain ||Mark_Phillips||; during a state visit to Germany in October, angry demonstrators in ||Dresden|| threw eggs at her; and, in November, ||1992_Windsor_Castle_fire||, one of her official residences. The monarchy came under increased criticism and public scrutiny. In an unusually personal speech, the Queen said that any institution must expect criticism, but suggested it be done with "a touch of humour, gentleness and understanding". Two days later, Prime Minister ||John_Major|| announced reforms to the royal finances planned since the previous year, including the Queen paying ||Income_tax|| from 1993 onwards, and a reduction in the ||Civil_list||. In December, Prince Charles and his wife, Diana, formally separated. The year ended with a lawsuit, as the Queen sued ||The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)|| newspaper for breach of copyright when it published the text of her ||Royal_Christmas_Message|| two days before it was broadcast. The newspaper was forced to pay her legal fees and donated £200,000 to charity. The Queen's lawyers had taken action against The Sun five years earlier for breach of copyright, after it published a photograph of the Duchess of York and ||Princess_Beatrice||. The case was solved with an out-of-court settlement that made the newspaper pay $180,000. In October 1994, the Queen became the first reigning British monarch to set foot in Russia. The four-day visit is said to be one of the most important foreign trips of her reign. The Queen and her husband attended events in Moscow and St. Petersburg. In the years to follow, public revelations on the state of Charles and Diana's marriage continued. Even though support for republicanism in Britain seemed higher than at any time in living memory, republicanism was still a minority viewpoint, and the Queen herself had high approval ratings. Criticism was focused on the institution of the monarchy itself and the Queen's wider family rather than her own behaviour and actions. In consultation with her husband and the Prime Minister, John Major, as well as the ||Archbishop_of_Canterbury||, ||George_Carey||, and her private secretary, ||Robert_Fellowes,_Baron_Fellowes||, she wrote to Charles and Diana at the end of December 1995, saying a divorce was desirable. In August 1997, a year after the divorce, Diana was killed in ||Death_of_Diana,_Princess_of_Wales||. The Queen was on holiday with her extended family at ||Balmoral_Castle||. Diana's two sons by Charles—Princes ||Prince_William,_Duke_of_Cambridge|| and ||Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex||—wanted to attend church and so the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh took them that morning. Afterwards, for five days the Queen and the Duke shielded their grandsons from the intense press interest by keeping them at Balmoral where they could grieve in private, but the royal family's silence and seclusion, and the failure to fly a flag at ||Half-mast|| over Buckingham Palace, caused public dismay. Pressured by the hostile reaction, the Queen agreed to return to London and do a ||Addresses_to_the_nation_by_Elizabeth_II|| on 5 September, the day before ||Funeral_of_Diana,_Princess_of_Wales||. In the broadcast, she expressed admiration for Diana and her feelings "as a grandmother" for the two princes. As a result, much of the public hostility evaporated. In October 1997, Elizabeth and Philip made a state visit to India, which included a controversial visit to the site of the ||Jallianwala_Bagh_massacre|| to pay her respects. Protesters chanted "Killer Queen, go back", and there were demands for her to apologise for the action of British troops 78 years earlier. At the memorial in the park, she and the Duke paid their respects by laying a wreath and stood for a 30‑second ||Moment_of_silence||. As a result, much of the fury among the public softened and the protests were called off. In November of that year, the Queen and her husband held a reception at ||Banqueting_House|| to mark their golden wedding anniversary. She made a speech and praised Philip for his role as a consort, referring to him as "my strength and stay". Golden Jubilee  Greeting ||NASA|| employees at the ||Goddard_Space_Flight_Center||, ||Maryland||, May 2007 On the eve of the new millennium, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh boarded a vessel from ||Southwark||, bound for the ||Millennium_Dome||. Before passing under ||Tower_Bridge||, the Queen lit the National Millennium Beacon in the ||Pool_of_London||, using a laser torch. Just before midnight, the Queen officially opened the Dome. The Queen and the Duke joined ||Tony_Blair|| and ||Cherie_Blair||, in singing ||Auld_Lang_Syne||, during which the Queen held hands with Philip and Tony Blair. In 2002, Elizabeth marked her ||Golden_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II||, the 50th anniversary of her accession. Her sister and mother died in February and March respectively, and the media speculated whether the Jubilee would be a success or a failure. She again undertook an extensive tour of her realms, which began in Jamaica in February, where she called the farewell banquet "memorable" after a power cut plunged the ||King%27s_House,_Jamaica||, the ||Official_residence|| of the ||Governor-General_of_Jamaica||, into darkness. As in 1977, there were street parties and commemorative events, and monuments were named to honour the occasion. A million people attended each day of the three-day main Jubilee celebration in London, and the enthusiasm shown by the public for the Queen was greater than many journalists had expected. Though generally healthy throughout her life, in 2003 the Queen had ||Keyhole_surgery|| on both knees. In October 2006, she missed the opening of the new ||Emirates_Stadium|| because of a strained back muscle that had been troubling her since the summer.  The Queen meeting with ||Vladimir_Putin|| alongside ||Tony_Blair|| in 2005 In May 2007, ||The_Daily_Telegraph||, citing unnamed sources, reported the Queen was "exasperated and frustrated" by the policies of Tony Blair, that she was concerned the ||British_Armed_Forces|| were overstretched in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that she had raised concerns over rural and countryside issues with Blair. She was, however, said to admire Blair's efforts to ||Northern_Ireland_peace_process|| in ||Northern_Ireland||. She became the first British monarch to celebrate a diamond wedding anniversary in November 2007. On 20 March 2008, at the ||Church_of_Ireland|| ||St_Patrick%27s_Cathedral,_Armagh_(Church_of_Ireland)||, the Queen attended the first ||Royal_Maundy|| held outside England and Wales. Elizabeth addressed the UN General Assembly for a second time in 2010, again in her capacity as Queen of all Commonwealth realms and Head of the Commonwealth. The UN Secretary General, ||Ban_Ki-moon||, introduced her as "an anchor for our age". During her visit to New York, which followed a tour of Canada, she officially opened a memorial garden for British victims of the ||September_11_attacks||. The Queen's 11-day visit to Australia in October 2011 was her 16th visit to the country since 1954. By invitation of the Irish President, ||Mary_McAleese||, she made the first ||State_visit_of_Elizabeth_II_to_the_Republic_of_Ireland|| by a British monarch in May 2011. Diamond Jubilee and longevity  Visiting ||Birmingham|| in July 2012 as part of her Diamond Jubilee tour The Queen's ||2012_Diamond_Jubilee|| marked 60 years on the throne, and celebrations were held throughout her realms, the wider Commonwealth, and beyond. In a message released on ||Accession_day#United_Kingdom||, Elizabeth wrote:In this special year, as I dedicate myself anew to your service, I hope we will all be reminded of the power of togetherness and the convening strength of family, friendship and good neighbourliness ... I hope also that this Jubilee year will be a time to give thanks for the great advances that have been made since 1952 and to look forward to the future with clear head and warm heart. She and her husband undertook an extensive tour of the United Kingdom, while her children and grandchildren embarked on royal tours of other Commonwealth states on her behalf. On 4 June, Jubilee beacons were lit around the world. While touring Manchester as part of her Jubilee celebrations, the Queen made a surprise appearance at a wedding party at Manchester Town Hall, which then made international headlines. In November, the Queen and her husband celebrated their blue sapphire wedding anniversary (65th). On 18 December, she became the first British sovereign to attend a peacetime ||Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom|| since ||George_III|| in 1781. The Queen, who opened the ||1976_Summer_Olympics|| in Montreal, also opened the ||2012_Summer_Olympics|| and ||2012_Summer_Paralympics|| in London, making her the first ||List_of_people_who_have_opened_the_Olympic_Games|| two Olympic Games in two countries. For the London Olympics, she played herself in ||Production_of_the_James_Bond_films#Happy_and_Glorious_(2012)|| as part of the ||2012_Summer_Olympics_opening_ceremony||, alongside ||Daniel_Craig|| as ||James_Bond||. On 4 April 2013, she received an honorary ||BAFTA|| for her patronage of the film industry and was called "the most memorable ||Bond_girl|| yet" at the award ceremony. On 3 March 2013, Elizabeth was admitted to ||King_Edward_VII%27s_Hospital|| as a precaution after developing symptoms of ||Gastroenteritis||. She returned to Buckingham Palace the following day. A week later, she signed the new ||Charter_of_the_Commonwealth||. Because of her age and the need for her to limit travelling, in 2013 she chose not to attend the biennial ||Commonwealth_Heads_of_Government_Meeting|| for the first time in 40 years. She was represented at the summit in Sri Lanka by Prince Charles. She underwent ||Cataract_surgery|| in May 2018. In March 2019, she opted to give up driving on public roads, largely as a consequence of a car crash involving her husband two months earlier.  The Queen opening the ||Borders_Railway|| on the day she became the longest-reigning British monarch, 2015. In her speech, she said she had never aspired to achieve that milestone. The Queen surpassed her great-great-grandmother, ||Queen_Victoria||, to become the ||List_of_British_monarchs_by_longevity|| on 21 December 2007, and the ||List_of_monarchs_in_Britain_by_length_of_reign#Overall|| and ||List_of_longest-reigning_monarchs|| and female head of state in the world on 9 September 2015. She became the oldest current monarch after ||Abdullah_of_Saudi_Arabia|| died on 23 January 2015. She later became the longest-reigning current monarch and the ||List_of_current_state_leaders_by_date_of_assumption_of_office|| following the death of ||Bhumibol_Adulyadej|| of Thailand on 13 October 2016, and the ||Lists_of_state_leaders_by_age|| on the resignation of ||Robert_Mugabe|| on 21 November 2017. On 6 February 2017, she became the first British monarch to commemorate a ||Sapphire_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II||, and on 20 November, she was the first British monarch to celebrate a platinum wedding anniversary. Philip had retired from his official duties as the Queen's consort in August 2017. On 20 April 2018, the government leaders of the Commonwealth of Nations announced that she will be succeeded by Charles as ||Head_of_the_Commonwealth||. The Queen stated it was her "sincere wish" that Charles would follow her in the role. COVID-19 pandemic On 19 March 2020, the Queen moved to Windsor Castle and sequestered there as a precaution, as the ||COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_Kingdom||. Public engagements were cancelled and Windsor Castle followed a strict sanitary protocol nicknamed "HMS Bubble". On 5 April, in a televised broadcast watched by an estimated 24 million viewers in the United Kingdom, she asked people to "take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return". She added, "we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again". On 8 May, the 75th anniversary of ||VE_Day||, in a broadcast at 9 pm, the exact time at which her father George VI broadcast in 1945, she asked people to "never give up, never despair". In October, she carried out her first public engagement since March, and visited the UK's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory to officially open its new Energetics Analysis Centre. On 4 November, she appeared masked for the first time, during a private pilgrimage to the ||The_Unknown_Warrior|| at Westminster Abbey, to mark the centenary of his burial. The same month, due to the rise in the risk of COVID infection, the Queen and Prince Philip returned to Windsor Castle, where they celebrated their 73rd wedding anniversary. On 9 January 2021, Buckingham Palace announced that the Queen and Prince Philip had received their first dose of vaccine against COVID-19. She received her second dose in April, before her first in-person public appearance of 2021. Philip ||Death_and_funeral_of_Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh||, making Elizabeth the first British monarch to reign as a widow or widower since ||Queen_Victoria||. She remarked in private that his death "left a huge void". Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the Queen sat alone at Philip's funeral service, which evoked sympathy from people around the world. Despite the pandemic, she took part in the ||2021_State_Opening_of_Parliament||, and hosted a reception for G7 leaders in Cornwall, as part of the ||47th_G7_summit||. On 5 July, the 73rd anniversary of the founding of the NHS, she announced in a personal handwritten message that the NHS would be awarded the ||George_Cross|| to "recognise all NHS staff, past and present, across all disciplines and all four nations".  The Queen in a virtual meeting with ||Dame_Cindy_Kiro|| during the COVID-19 pandemic, October 2021 In October 2021, Elizabeth began using a ||Walking_stick|| for comfort during public engagements for the first time since her operation in 2004. On 19 October, she declined ||The_Oldie||'s ||Oldie_of_the_Year_Award||, telling nominator ||Gyles_Brandreth|| in a letter: "You're only as old as you feel". She was briefly hospitalised on 20 October, after cancelling a visit to Northern Ireland on health grounds, but left hospital the following day. The hospitalisation was only officially confirmed after ||The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)|| ran the story as a front-page exclusive. The same week, she cancelled her plans to travel to the ||2021_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference|| in Glasgow following advice from her doctor to rest, instead delivering her address via video message. She was also unable to attend the 2021 ||National_Service_of_Remembrance|| after spraining her back; this was said to be unrelated to previous medical advice for rest. On 21 November, after returning to public duties, she attended a rare joint christening of two of her great-grandchildren at the Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park, Berkshire. On 30 November, ||Barbados|| removed the Queen as head of state, ||Republicanism_in_Barbados||. In her 2021 Christmas broadcast, the Queen paid a personal tribute to her "beloved Philip", saying, "That mischievous, inquiring twinkle was as bright at the end as when I first set eyes on him". On 20 February 2022, Buckingham Palace announced that the Queen had tested positive for COVID-19 and was experiencing "mild cold-like symptoms". A number of other cases were diagnosed at Windsor Castle and among family members of the Queen. The Queen cancelled two virtual audiences on 22 February. She held a phone conversation with the prime minister on 23 February amid ||2021%E2%80%932022_Russo-Ukrainian_crisis|| (Russia ||2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine|| one day later). On 28 February, it was reported that she had recovered and spent time with her family at Frogmore. On 6 March, it was reported that the Queen had made Windsor Castle her permanent residence and would not return to live at Buckingham Palace. On 7 March, the Queen met Canadian Prime Minister ||Justin_Trudeau|| at Windsor Castle, which was her first in-person engagement since her COVID diagnosis. She met Canada's first indigenous governor general, ||Mary_Simon||, at Windsor Castle a week later. Platinum Jubilee The Queen's ||Platinum_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II|| began on 6 February 2022. It marks 70 years since she acceded to the throne upon her father's death. She held a reception for pensioners, local ||Women%27s_Institute|| members and charity volunteers on the eve of the date at ||Sandringham_House||. In her Accession Day message, Elizabeth renewed her commitment to a lifetime of public service, which she originally made in 1947. On 14 March, the Queen was unable to attend the annual ||Commonwealth_Day|| service; which had a special focus on her Platinum Jubilee year. It was reported, however, this was due to mobility issues and not health-related problems, with the Prince of Wales representing her at the service. On 29 March, the Queen was present at ||A_Service_of_Thanksgiving_for_the_life_of_The_Duke_of_Edinburgh|| at Westminster Abbey, and it was reported that she was "actively involved" in every detail of the service. She does not intend to ||Abdicate||, though Prince Charles began to take on more of her duties when she entered her nineties and began carrying out fewer public engagements. Public perception and character Main article: ||Personality_and_image_of_Elizabeth_II|| Since Elizabeth rarely gives interviews, little is known of her personal feelings. She has not explicitly expressed her own political opinions in a public forum, and it is against convention to ask or reveal her views. During the ||Miners%27_strike_of_1984%E2%80%9385|| ||The_Times|| journalist ||Paul_Routledge|| asked the Queen for her opinions on the strike, to which she replied that it was "all about one man" (a reference to ||Arthur_Scargill||), which Routledge disagreed with. Routledge was widely criticised in the media for asking the question; he said he was not initially due to be present for the Queen's visit and was unaware of the protocols. After the ||2014_Scottish_independence_referendum||, Prime Minister ||David_Cameron|| said that she was pleased with the outcome. She had arguably issued a public coded statement about the referendum by telling one woman outside Balmoral Kirk that she hoped people would think "very carefully" about the outcome. It emerged later that Cameron had asked the Queen to register her concern. Elizabeth has a deep sense of religious and civic duty, and takes her ||Coronation_Oath|| seriously. Aside from her ||Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom#Religious_role|| as ||Supreme_Governor_of_the_Church_of_England|| of the ||State_religion|| ||Church_of_England||, she is a member of that church and also of the national ||Church_of_Scotland||. She has demonstrated support for ||Interfaith_dialogue|| relations and has met with leaders of other churches and religions, including five popes: ||Pope_Pius_XII||, ||Pope_John_XXIII||, ||Pope_John_Paul_II||, ||Pope_Benedict_XVI|| and ||Pope_Francis||. A personal note about her faith often features in her annual ||Christmas_Message|| broadcast to the Commonwealth. In 2000, she said: To many of us, our beliefs are of fundamental importance. For me the teachings of Christ and my own personal accountability before God provide a framework in which I try to lead my life. I, like so many of you, have drawn great comfort in difficult times from Christ's words and example. She is ||Patron|| of over 600 organisations and charities. The ||Charities_Aid_Foundation|| estimated that Elizabeth has helped raised over £1.4 billion for her patronages during her reign. Her main leisure interests include ||Equestrianism|| and dogs, especially her ||Pembroke_Welsh_Corgi||. Her lifelong ||Royal_corgis|| began in 1933 with Dookie, the first corgi owned by her family. Scenes of a relaxed, informal home life have occasionally been witnessed; she and her family, from time to time, prepare a meal together and do the washing up afterwards. In the 1950s, as a young woman at the start of her reign, Elizabeth was depicted as a glamorous "fairytale Queen". After the trauma of the Second World War, it was a time of hope, a period of progress and achievement heralding a "new Elizabethan age". Lord Altrincham's accusation in 1957 that her speeches sounded like those of a "priggish schoolgirl" was an extremely rare criticism. In the late 1960s, attempts to portray a more modern image of the monarchy were made in the television documentary ||Royal_Family_(documentary)|| and by televising Prince Charles's ||Investiture_of_the_Prince_of_Wales||. Her wardrobe developed a recognisable, signature style driven more by function than fashion. She dresses with an eye toward what is appropriate, rather than what is in vogue. In public, she took to wearing mostly solid-colour overcoats and decorative hats, which allow her to be seen easily in a crowd. Her wardrobe is handled by a team that includes five dressers, a dressmaker, and a milliner.  At her ||Silver_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II|| in 1977, the crowds and celebrations were genuinely enthusiastic, but, in the 1980s, public criticism of the royal family increased, as the personal and working lives of Elizabeth's children came under media scrutiny. Her popularity sank to a low point in the 1990s. Under pressure from public opinion, she began to pay income tax for the first time, and Buckingham Palace was opened to the public. Discontent with the monarchy reached its peak on the death of the former Princess of Wales, Diana, although Elizabeth's personal popularity—as well as general support for the monarchy—rebounded after her live television broadcast to the world five days after Diana's death.  The Queen meeting children in ||Brisbane||, Australia, October 1982 In November 1999, a ||1999_Australian_republic_referendum|| on the future of the ||Australian_monarchy|| favoured its retention in preference to an indirectly elected head of state. Many republicans have credited Elizabeth's personal popularity with the survival of the monarchy in Australia. Prime Minister ||Julia_Gillard|| said in 2010 there was a "deep affection" for the Queen in Australia and said another referendum on the monarchy should wait until after her reign. Her successor, ||Malcolm_Turnbull||, who led the republican campaign in 1999, similarly believes that Australians would not vote to become a republic in her lifetime. "She's been an extraordinary head of state", Turnbull said in 2021, "and I think frankly, in Australia, there are more Elizabethans than there are monarchists". Similarly, referendums in both ||2008_Tuvaluan_constitutional_referendum|| and ||2009_Vincentian_constitutional_referendum|| saw voters reject proposals to become republics. Polls in Britain in 2006 and 2007 revealed strong support for Elizabeth, and in 2012, her Diamond Jubilee year, approval ratings hit 90 percent. Her family came under scrutiny again in 2019 and the early 2020s due to her son Andrew's association with convicted sex offenders ||Jeffrey_Epstein|| and ||Ghislaine_Maxwell||, his ||Virginia_Giuffre_v._Prince_Andrew|| with ||Virginia_Giuffre|| amidst accusations of sexual impropriety, and her grandson Harry and his wife ||Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex||'s ||Megxit|| and subsequent move to the United States. Elizabeth has been portrayed in a variety of media by many notable artists, including painters ||Pietro_Annigoni||, ||Peter_Blake_(artist)||, ||Chinwe_Chukwuogo-Roy||, ||Terence_Cuneo||, ||Lucian_Freud||, ||Rolf_Harris||, ||Damien_Hirst||, ||Juliet_Pannett|| and ||Tai-Shan_Schierenberg||. Notable photographers of Elizabeth have included ||Cecil_Beaton||, ||Yousuf_Karsh||, ||Annie_Leibovitz||, ||Patrick_Anson,_5th_Earl_of_Lichfield||, ||Terry_O%27Neill_(photographer)||, ||John_Swannell_(photographer)|| and ||Dorothy_Wilding||. The first official portrait photograph of Elizabeth was taken by ||Marcus_Adams_(photographer)|| in 1926. Finances Further information: ||Finances_of_the_British_royal_family||  ||Sandringham_House||, Elizabeth's private residence in ||Sandringham,_Norfolk|| Elizabeth's personal fortune has been the subject of speculation for many years. In 1971, ||Jock_Colville||, her former private secretary and a director of her bank, ||Coutts||, estimated her wealth at £2 million (equivalent to about £29 million in 2020). In 1993, Buckingham Palace called estimates of £100 million "grossly overstated". In 2002, she inherited an estate worth an estimated £70 million from her mother. The ||Sunday_Times_Rich_List_2020|| estimated her personal wealth at £350 million, making her the 372nd richest person in the UK. She was number one on the list when it began in the ||Sunday_Times_Rich_List_1989||, with a reported wealth of £5.2 billion, which included state assets that were not hers personally, (approximately £13.2 billion in today's value). The ||Royal_Collection||, which includes thousands of historic works of art and the ||British_Crown_Jewels||, is not owned personally but is held ||Trust_law|| by the Queen, as are her official residences, such as ||Buckingham_Palace|| and ||Windsor_Castle||, and the ||Duchy_of_Lancaster||, a property portfolio valued at £472 million in 2015. (The ||Paradise_Papers||, leaked in 2017, show that the Duchy of Lancaster held investments in two ||Tax_haven|| overseas territories, the ||Cayman_Islands|| and ||Bermuda||.) Sandringham House and ||Balmoral_Castle|| are personally owned by the Queen. The British ||Crown_Estate|| – with holdings of £14.3 billion in 2019 – is held in trust and cannot be sold or owned by her in a personal capacity. Titles, styles, honours, and arms ||Royal_cypher|| of Elizabeth II, surmounted by ||St_Edward%27s_Crown||Personal flag of Elizabeth II Titles and styles Main article: ||List_of_titles_and_honours_of_Elizabeth_II|| 21 April 1926 – 11 December 1936: Her Royal Highness Princess Elizabeth of York 11 December 1936 – 20 November 1947: Her Royal Highness The Princess Elizabeth 20 November 1947 – 6 February 1952: Her Royal Highness The Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh Since 6 February 1952: Her Majesty The Queen Elizabeth has held many titles and honorary military positions throughout the ||Commonwealth_of_Nations||, is sovereign of many orders in her own countries, and has received honours and awards from around the world. In each of her realms she has a distinct title that follows a similar formula: Queen of Jamaica and her other realms and territories in Jamaica, Queen of Australia and her other realms and territories in Australia, etc. In the ||Channel_Islands|| and ||Isle_of_Man||, which are ||Crown_dependencies|| rather than separate realms, she is known as ||Duke_of_Normandy|| and ||Lord_of_Mann||, respectively. Additional styles include ||Fidei_defensor|| and ||Duke_of_Lancaster||. When conversing with the Queen, the correct etiquette is to address her initially as Your Majesty and thereafter as Ma'am pronounced , with a short 'a' as in jam. Arms See also: ||Flags_of_Elizabeth_II|| From 21 April 1944 until her accession, Elizabeth's arms consisted of a ||Lozenge_(heraldry)|| bearing the ||Royal_coat_of_arms_of_the_United_Kingdom|| differenced with a ||Label_(heraldry)|| of three points ||Argent||, the centre point bearing a ||Tudor_rose|| and the first and third a ||St_George%27s_Cross||. Upon her accession, she inherited the various arms her father held as sovereign. The Queen also possesses ||Banner#Heraldic_banners|| and personal flags for use in ||Royal_Standard_of_the_United_Kingdom||, ||Royal_standards_of_Canada||, ||Queen%27s_Personal_Australian_Flag||, ||Queen%27s_Personal_Flag_for_New_Zealand||, ||Queen%27s_Personal_Jamaican_Flag||, and elsewhere.

As a ||Constitutional_monarch||, the Queen is head of state, but her executive powers are limited by ||Constitutional_convention_(political_custom)||.  Her godparents were: King George V and Queen Mary; Lord Strathmore; ||Prince_Arthur,_Duke_of_Connaught_and_Strathearn|| (her paternal great-granduncle); ||Princess_Mary,_Viscountess_Lascelles|| (her paternal aunt); and ||Mary_Elphinstone,_Lady_Elphinstone|| (her maternal aunt).  Television coverage of the coronation was instrumental in boosting the medium's popularity; the number of ||Television_licensing_in_the_United_Kingdom|| doubled to 3 million, and many of the more than 20 million British viewers watched television for the first time in the homes of their friends or neighbours. In North America, just under 100 million viewers watched recorded broadcasts.  The only previous state visit by a British monarch to Russia was made by King Edward VII in 1908. The King never stepped ashore, and met Nicholas II on royal yachts off the Baltic port of what is now Tallinn, Estonia.
