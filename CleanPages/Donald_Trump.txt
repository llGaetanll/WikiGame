14, 1946) is an American ||Political_career_of_Donald_Trump||, ||Media_career_of_Donald_Trump||, and ||Business_career_of_Donald_Trump|| who served as the 45th ||President_of_the_United_States|| from 2017 to 2021. Born and raised in ||Queens||, New York City, Trump graduated from the ||Wharton_School_of_the_University_of_Pennsylvania|| with a ||Bachelor%27s_degree|| in 1968. He became president of his father ||Fred_Trump||'s real estate business in 1971 and renamed it ||The_Trump_Organization||. Trump expanded the company's operations to building and renovating skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He later started ||The_Trump_Organization#Other_ventures_and_investments||, mostly by licensing his name. From 2004 to 2015, he co-produced and hosted the reality television series ||The_Apprentice_(American_TV_series)||. Trump and his businesses have been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal ||Legal_affairs_of_Donald_Trump||, including six bankruptcies. ||Trump%27s_political_positions|| have been described as ||Populist||, ||Protectionist||, ||Isolationist||, and ||Nationalist||. He entered the ||2016_United_States_presidential_election|| as a ||Republican_Party_(United_States)|| and was elected in an ||Upset_victory|| over ||Democratic_Party_(United_States)|| nominee ||Hillary_Clinton|| while ||List_of_United_States_presidential_elections_in_which_the_winner_lost_the_popular_vote||, becoming the first U.S. president with no ||List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_by_previous_experience||. The ||Special_Counsel_investigation_(2017%E2%80%932019)|| led by ||Robert_Mueller|| established that ||Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections|| to benefit the ||Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign||, but not that members of the Trump campaign ||Criminal_conspiracy|| or coordinated with Russian election interference activities. Trump's election and policies sparked ||Protests_against_Donald_Trump||. Trump made ||Veracity_of_statements_by_Donald_Trump|| during his campaigns and ||Presidency_of_Donald_Trump||, to a degree unprecedented in ||American_politics||, and ||List_of_conspiracy_theories_promoted_by_Donald_Trump||. Many of his comments and actions have been ||Racial_views_of_Donald_Trump||, and many as ||Misogyny||. Trump ordered ||Trump_travel_ban|| on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted funding towards building ||Trump_wall|| on the ||United_States%E2%80%93Mexico_border||, and implemented a ||Trump_administration_family_separation_policy|| for apprehended migrants. He signed the ||Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act_of_2017||, which cut taxes for individuals and businesses and rescinded the ||Individual_shared_responsibility_provision|| penalty of the ||Affordable_Care_Act||. He appointed more than ||List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_Donald_Trump||, including three to the ||United_States_Supreme_Court||. In foreign policy, Trump pursued an ||America_First_(policy)#Presidency_of_Donald_Trump|| agenda. He withdrew the U.S. from the ||Trans-Pacific_Partnership|| trade agreement, the ||Paris_Agreement|| on ||Climate_change||, and the ||United_States_withdrawal_from_the_Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action||. He initiated ||China%E2%80%93United_States_trade_war|| that negatively impacted the U.S. economy. Trump ||2018%E2%80%9319_Korean_peace_process|| with North Korean leader ||Kim_Jong-un||, but made no progress on ||Denuclearization||. He reacted slowly to the ||COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States||, ignored or contradicted many recommendations from health officials in ||Trump_administration_communication_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic||, and ||Misinformation_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic_by_the_United_States|| about unproven treatments and the availability of testing.  Trump lost the ||2020_United_States_presidential_election|| to ||Joe_Biden|| but refused to ||Concession_(politics)||. He falsely claimed that there was widespread ||Electoral_fraud|| and ||Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election|| by pressuring government officials, mounting scores of ||List_of_lawsuits_relating_to_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election||, and obstructing the ||Presidential_transition_of_Joe_Biden||.

Contents Personal life Early life  Trump at the ||New_York_Military_Academy|| in 1964 Donald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at ||Jamaica_Hospital_Medical_Center|| in the borough of ||Queens|| in New York City, the fourth child of ||Fred_Trump||, a ||The_Bronx||-born real estate developer whose parents were German immigrants, and ||Mary_Anne_MacLeod_Trump||, an immigrant from Scotland. Trump grew up with older siblings ||Maryanne_Trump_Barry||, ||Fred_Trump_Jr.||, and Elizabeth, and younger brother ||Robert_Trump|| in the ||Jamaica_Estates,_Queens|| neighborhood of Queens, and attended the private ||Kew-Forest_School|| from kindergarten through seventh grade. At age 13, he was enrolled at the ||New_York_Military_Academy||, a private boarding school, and in 1964, he enrolled at ||Fordham_University||. Two years later, he transferred to the ||Wharton_School_of_the_University_of_Pennsylvania||, graduating in May 1968 with a ||Bachelor_of_Science|| in economics. In 2015, Trump's lawyer ||Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)|| threatened Trump's colleges, high school, and the ||College_Board|| with legal action if they released Trump's academic records. While in college, Trump obtained four student ||Conscription_in_the_United_States|| deferments during the ||Vietnam_War|| era. In 1966, he was deemed fit for military service based upon a medical examination, and in July 1968 a local draft board classified him as eligible to serve. In October 1968, he was classified 1-Y, a conditional medical deferment, and in 1972, he was reclassified 4-F due to ||Exostosis||, permanently disqualifying him from service. Family Main article: ||Family_of_Donald_Trump|| In 1977, Trump married Czech model ||Ivana_Trump||. They have three children, ||Donald_Trump_Jr.|| (born 1977), ||Ivanka_Trump|| (born 1981), and ||Eric_Trump|| (born 1984). Ivana became a naturalized United States citizen in 1988. The couple divorced in 1992, following Trump's affair with actress ||Marla_Maples||. He and Maples have one daughter, ||Tiffany_Trump|| (born 1993). They married in 1993, separated in 1997, and divorced in 1999. Tiffany was raised by Marla in California. In 2005, Trump married Slovenian model ||Melania_Trump||. They have one son, Barron (born 2006). Melania gained U.S. citizenship in 2006. Religion Trump went to ||Sunday_school|| and was ||Confirmation|| in 1959 at the ||First_Presbyterian_Church_in_Jamaica||, Queens. In the 1970s, his parents joined the ||Marble_Collegiate_Church|| in Manhattan, which belongs to the ||Reformed_Church_in_America||. The pastor at Marble, ||Norman_Vincent_Peale||, ministered to the family until his death in 1993. Trump has described him as a mentor. In 2015, the church stated Trump "is not an active member". In 2019, he appointed his personal pastor, televangelist ||Paula_White||, to the White House ||Office_of_Public_Liaison||. In 2020, he said he identified as a ||Non-denominational_Christian||. Health habits Trump says he has never drunk alcohol, smoked cigarettes, or used drugs and that he sleeps about four or five hours a night. He has called golfing his "primary form of exercise" but usually does not walk the course. He considers exercise a waste of energy, because exercise depletes the body's energy "like a battery, with a finite amount of energy." In 2015, Trump's campaign released a letter from his longtime personal physician, ||Harold_Bornstein||, stating that Trump would "be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency." In 2018, Bornstein said Trump had dictated the contents of the letter, and that three Trump agents had seized his medical records in a February 2017 raid on the doctor's office. Wealth Main article: ||Wealth_of_Donald_Trump|| See also: ||Tax_returns_of_Donald_Trump|| In 1982, Trump made the initial ||Forbes|| list of wealthy people for holding a share of his family's estimated $200 million net worth. His losses in the 1980s dropped him from the list between 1990 and 1995. After filing mandatory financial disclosure forms with the ||Federal_Election_Commission|| in July 2015, he announced a net worth of about $10 billion. Records released by the FEC showed at least $1.4 billion in assets and $265 million in liabilities. Forbes estimated his net worth at $4.5 billion in 2015 and $3.1 billion in 2018. In its 2021 billionaires ranking, it was $2.4 billion (1,299th in the world), making him one of the ||List_of_richest_American_politicians||.  Trump (far right) and wife Ivana in the receiving line of a state dinner for King ||Fahd_of_Saudi_Arabia|| in 1985, with U.S. president ||Ronald_Reagan|| and First Lady ||Nancy_Reagan|| Journalist Jonathan Greenberg reported in 2018 that Trump, using the pseudonym "||John_Barron_(pseudonym)||" and claiming to be a Trump Organization official, called him in 1984 to falsely assert that he owned "in excess of ninety percent" of the Trump family's business, to secure a higher ranking on the ||Forbes_400|| list of wealthy Americans. Greenberg also wrote that Forbes had vastly overestimated Trump's wealth and wrongly included him on the Forbes 400 rankings of 1982, 1983, and 1984. Trump has often said he began his career with "a small loan of one million dollars" from his father, and that he had to pay it back with interest. He was a millionaire by age eight, borrowed at least $60 million from his father, largely failed to repay those loans, and received another $413 million (adjusted for inflation) from his father's company. In 2018, he and his family were reported to have committed tax fraud, and the New York tax department began investigating. His investments underperformed the stock and New York property markets. Forbes estimated in October 2018 that his net worth declined from $4.5 billion in 2015 to $3.1 billion in 2017 and his product licensing income from $23 million to $3 million. Contrary to his claims of financial health and business acumen, Trump's tax returns from 1985 to 1994 show net losses totaling $1.17 billion. The losses were higher than those of almost every other American taxpayer. The losses in 1990 and 1991, more than $250 million each year, were more than double those of the nearest losers. In 1995, his reported losses were $915.7 million. Over twenty years, Trump lost hundreds of millions of dollars and deferred declaring $287 million in forgiven debt as taxable income. His income mainly came from his share in ||The_Apprentice_(American_TV_series)|| and businesses in which he was a minority partner, and his losses mainly from majority-owned businesses. Much income was in ||Tax_credit|| for his losses, which let him avoid annual income tax payments or lowered them to $750. In the last decade, he balanced his businesses' losses by selling and borrowing against assets, including a $100 million mortgage on ||Trump_Tower|| (due in 2022) and the liquidation of over $200 million in stocks and bonds. He personally guaranteed $421 million in debt, most of which is due by 2024.  As of October 2020, Trump has over $1 billion in debts, secured by his assets. He owed $640 million to banks and trust organizations, including ||Deutsche_Bank||, ||UBS||, and ||Bank_of_China||, and approximately $450 million to unknown creditors. The value of his assets exceeds his debt. Business career Main article: ||Business_career_of_Donald_Trump|| Further information: ||Business_projects_of_Donald_Trump_in_Russia|| Real estate  Trump Tower in ||Midtown_Manhattan|| Starting in 1968, Trump was employed at his father Fred's real estate company, Trump Management, which owned middle-class rental housing in New York City's outer boroughs. In 1971, he became president of the company and began using ||The_Trump_Organization|| as an ||Umbrella_brand||. Manhattan developments Trump attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family's first Manhattan venture, the renovation of the derelict ||Grand_Hyatt_New_York||, adjacent to ||Grand_Central_Terminal||. The financing was facilitated by a $400 million city property tax abatement arranged by Fred Trump, who also joined Hyatt in guaranteeing $70 million in bank construction financing. The hotel reopened in 1980 as the ||Grand_Hyatt_New_York||, and that same year, Trump obtained rights to develop ||Trump_Tower||, a ||Mixed-use_development|| skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan. The building houses the headquarters of the Trump Corporation and Trump's ||Political_action_committee|| and was Trump's primary residence until 2019. In 1988, Trump acquired the ||Plaza_Hotel|| in Manhattan with a loan of $425 million from a consortium of banks. Two years later, the hotel filed for bankruptcy protection, and a reorganization plan was approved in 1992. In 1995, Trump lost the hotel to Citibank and investors from Singapore and Saudi Arabia, who assumed $300 million of the debt. In 1996, Trump acquired the mostly vacant 71-story skyscraper at ||40_Wall_Street||, later also known as the Trump Building, and renovated it. In the early 1990s, Trump won the right to develop a 70-acre (28 ha) tract in the ||Lincoln_Square,_Manhattan|| neighborhood near the ||Hudson_River||. Struggling with debt from other ventures in 1994, Trump sold most of his interest in the project to Asian investors, who were able to finance completion of the project, ||Riverside_South,_Manhattan||. Mar-a-Lago Main article: ||Mar-a-Lago|| In 1985, Trump acquired the Mar-a-Lago estate in ||Palm_Beach,_Florida||. In 1995, he converted the estate into a private club with an initiation fee and annual dues. He continued to use a wing of the house as a private residence. In 2019, Trump declared Mar-a-Lago his primary residence. Atlantic City casinos  Entrance of the ||Trump_Taj_Mahal|| in ||Atlantic_City|| In 1984, Trump opened ||Harrah%27s_at_Trump_Plaza||, a hotel and casino in ||Atlantic_City,_New_Jersey||, with financing and management help from the ||Holiday_Corporation||. It was unprofitable, and Trump paid Holiday $70 million in May 1986 to take sole control. Trump had earlier bought a hotel and casino in Atlantic City from the ||Hilton_Worldwide|| for $320 million. On completion in 1985, it became ||Golden_Nugget_Atlantic_City||. His wife Ivana managed it until 1988. Trump bought a third Atlantic City venue in 1988, the ||Hard_Rock_Hotel_%26_Casino_Atlantic_City||. It was financed with $675 million in ||Junk_bonds|| and completed for $1.1 billion, opening in April 1990. It went bankrupt in 1989. Reorganizing left him with half his initial stake and required him to personally guarantee future performance. To reduce his $900 million of personal debt, he sold his failing ||Trump_Shuttle|| airline, his ||Megayacht||, the ||Trump_Princess||, which had been leased to his casinos and kept docked, and other businesses. In 1995, Trump founded ||Trump_Hotels_%26_Casino_Resorts|| (THCR), which assumed ownership of Trump Plaza, Trump Castle, and the ||Majestic_Star_II|| in ||Gary,_Indiana||. THCR purchased the Taj Mahal in 1996 and went bankrupt in 2004, 2009, and 2014, leaving Trump with 10 percent ownership. He remained chairman until 2009. Golf courses Main article: ||Donald_Trump_and_golf|| The Trump Organization began building and buying golf courses in 1999. It owns fourteen and manages another three Trump-branded courses worldwide as of July 2020. Trump visited a Trump Organization property on 428 (nearly one in three) of the 1461 days of his presidency and is estimated to have played 261 rounds of golf, one every 5.6 days. Branding and licensing See also: ||List_of_things_named_after_Donald_Trump|| The Trump name has been licensed for various consumer products and services, including foodstuffs, apparel, ||Trump_Institute||, and home furnishings. According to an analysis by The Washington Post, there are more than fifty licensing or management deals involving Trump's name, which have generated at least $59 million in revenue for his companies. By 2018, only two consumer goods companies continued to license his name. Side ventures  Trump and New Jersey Generals quarterback ||Doug_Flutie|| at a 1985 press conference in the lobby of Trump Tower In September 1983, Trump purchased the ||New_Jersey_Generals||, a team in the ||United_States_Football_League||. After the 1985 season, the league folded, largely due to Trump's strategy of moving games to a fall schedule (where they competed with the ||NFL|| for audience) and trying to force a merger with the NFL by bringing an ||United_States_antitrust_law|| against the organization. Trump's businesses have hosted several boxing matches at the ||Boardwalk_Hall|| adjacent to and promoted as taking place at the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City. In 1989 and 1990, Trump lent his name to the ||Tour_de_Trump|| cycling stage race, which was an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the ||Tour_de_France|| or the ||Giro_d%27Italia||. In the late 1980s, Trump mimicked the actions of Wall Street's so-called ||Corporate_raider||. Trump began to purchase significant blocks of shares in various public companies, leading some observers to think he was engaged in ||Greenmail||. The New York Times found that Trump initially made millions of dollars in such stock transactions, but later "lost most, if not all, of those gains after investors stopped taking his takeover talk seriously". In 1988, Trump purchased the defunct ||Eastern_Air_Lines|| shuttle, with 21 planes and landing rights in New York City, Boston, and Washington, D.C. He financed the purchase with $380 million from 22 banks, rebranded the operation the Trump Shuttle, and operated it until 1992. Trump failed to earn a profit with the airline and sold it to ||USAir||.  Trump's star on the ||Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame|| In 1992, Trump, his siblings ||Maryanne_Trump_Barry||, Elizabeth, and ||Robert_Trump||, and his cousin John W. Walter, each with a 20 percent share, formed All County Building Supply & Maintenance Corp. The company had no offices and is alleged to have been a shell company for paying the vendors providing services and supplies for Trump's rental units and then billing those services and supplies to Trump Management with markups of 20–50 percent and more. The owners shared the proceeds generated by the markups. The increased costs were used as justification to get state approval for increasing the rents of Trump's rent-stabilized units. From 1996 to 2015, Trump owned all or part of the ||Miss_Universe|| pageants, including ||Miss_USA|| and ||Miss_Teen_USA||. Due to disagreements with ||CBS|| about scheduling, he took both pageants to ||NBC|| in 2002. In 2007, Trump received a star on the ||Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame|| for his work as producer of Miss Universe. NBC and ||Univision|| dropped the pageants from their broadcasting lineups in June 2015,  Trump University Main article: ||Trump_University|| In 2004, Trump co-founded ||Trump_University||, a company that sold real estate training courses priced from $1,500 to $35,000. After New York State authorities notified the company that its use of the word "university" violated state law, its name was changed to Trump Entrepreneur Initiative in 2010. In 2013, the State of New York filed a $40 million civil suit against Trump University, alleging that the company made false statements and defrauded consumers. In addition, two ||Class_action|| were filed in federal court against Trump and his companies. Internal documents revealed that employees were instructed to use a hard-sell approach, and former employees testified that Trump University had defrauded or lied to its students. Shortly after he won the 2016 presidential election, Trump agreed to pay a total of $25 million to settle the three cases. Foundation Main article: ||Donald_J._Trump_Foundation|| The Donald J. Trump Foundation was a private foundation established in 1988. In the foundation's final years its funds mostly came from donors other than Trump, who did not donate any personal funds to the charity from 2009 until 2014. The foundation gave to health care and sports-related charities, as well as conservative groups. In 2016, The Washington Post reported that the charity had committed several potential legal and ethical violations, including alleged self-dealing and possible tax evasion. Also in 2016, the New York State attorney general's office said the foundation appeared to be in violation of New York laws regarding charities and ordered it to immediately cease its fundraising activities in New York. Trump's team announced in December 2016 that the foundation would be dissolved. In June 2018, the New York attorney general's office filed a civil suit against the foundation, Trump, and his adult children, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and additional penalties. In December 2018, the foundation ceased operation and disbursed all its assets to other charities. In November 2019, a New York state judge ordered Trump to pay $2 million to a group of charities for misusing the foundation's funds, in part to finance his presidential campaign. Legal affairs and bankruptcies Main articles: ||Legal_affairs_of_Donald_Trump|| and ||List_of_lawsuits_involving_Donald_Trump|| ||Fixer_(person)|| ||Roy_Cohn|| served as Trump's lawyer and mentor for 13 years in the 1970s and 1980s. According to Trump, Cohn sometimes waived fees due to their friendship. In 1973, Cohn helped Trump countersue the United States government for $100 million over its charges that Trump's properties had racial discriminatory practices. Trump and Cohn lost that case when the countersuit was dismissed and the government's case went forward. In 1975, an agreement was struck requiring Trump's properties to furnish the New York Urban League with a list of all apartment vacancies, every week for two years, among other things. Cohn introduced political consultant ||Roger_Stone|| to Trump, who enlisted Stone's services to deal with the federal government. As of April 2018, Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions, according to a running tally by ||USA_Today||. While Trump has not filed for ||Personal_bankruptcy||, his over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York filed for ||Chapter_11_bankruptcy|| protection six times between 1991 and 2009. They continued to operate while the banks restructured debt and reduced Trump's shares in the properties. During the 1980s, more than 70 banks had lent Trump $4 billion, but in the aftermath of his corporate bankruptcies of the early 1990s, most major banks declined to lend to him, with only Deutsche Bank still willing to lend money. After the ||2021_United_States_Capitol_attack||, the bank decided not to do business with Trump or his company in the future. In April 2019, the ||House_Oversight_Committee|| issued ||Subpoena|| seeking financial details from Trump's banks, Deutsche Bank and ||Capital_One||, and his accounting firm, ||Mazars_USA||. In response, Trump sued the banks, Mazars, and committee chairman ||Elijah_Cummings|| to prevent the disclosures. In May, ||United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Columbia|| judge ||Amit_Mehta|| ruled that Mazars must comply with the subpoena, and judge ||Edgardo_Ramos|| of the ||United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_New_York|| ruled that the banks must also comply. Trump's attorneys appealed the rulings, arguing that Congress was attempting to usurp the "exercise of law-enforcement authority that the Constitution reserves to the executive branch". Media career Main article: ||Media_career_of_Donald_Trump|| Books Main article: ||Bibliography_of_Donald_Trump|| Using ||Ghostwriters||, Trump has produced up to 19 books on business, financial, or political topics under his name. His first book, ||The_Art_of_the_Deal|| (1987), was a ||The_New_York_Times_Best_Seller_list||. While Trump was credited as co-author, the entire book was written by ||Tony_Schwartz_(author)||. According to ||The_New_Yorker||, "The book expanded Trump's renown far beyond New York City, making him an emblem of the successful tycoon." Trump has called the volume his second favorite book, after the Bible. Film and television Main article: ||Donald_Trump_filmography|| Trump made ||Cameo_appearances|| in many films and television shows from 1985 to 2001. Trump had a sporadic relationship with the ||Professional_wrestling|| promotion ||WWE|| since the late 1980s. He appeared at ||WrestleMania_23|| in 2007 and was inducted into the celebrity wing of the ||WWE_Hall_of_Fame_(2013)||.  Trump at a ||New_York_Mets|| baseball game in 2009 Starting in the 1990s, Trump was a guest about 24 times on the nationally syndicated ||Howard_Stern_Show||. He also had his own short-form talk radio program called ||Trumped!|| (one to two minutes on weekdays) from 2004 to 2008. From 2011 until 2015, he was a weekly unpaid guest commentator on ||Fox_%26_Friends||. From 2004 to 2015, Trump was co-producer and host of reality shows The Apprentice and ||The_Celebrity_Apprentice||. On The Apprentice, Trump played the role of a chief executive, and contestants competed for a year of employment at the Trump Organization. On The Celebrity Apprentice, celebrities competed to win money for charities. On both shows, Trump eliminated contestants with the ||Catchphrase|| "You're fired." Trump, who had been a member since 1989, resigned from the ||SAG-AFTRA|| in February 2021 rather than face a disciplinary committee hearing for inciting the January 6, 2021, mob attack on the U.S. Capitol and for his "reckless campaign of misinformation aimed at discrediting and ultimately threatening the safety of journalists." Two days later, the union permanently barred him from readmission. Pre-presidential political career Main article: ||Political_career_of_Donald_Trump||  Trump and President ||Bill_Clinton|| in June 2000 Trump's political party affiliation changed numerous times. He registered as a Republican in 1987, a member of the ||Independence_Party_of_New_York||, the New York state affiliate of the ||Reform_Party_of_the_United_States_of_America||, in 1999, a Democrat in 2001, a Republican in 2009, unaffiliated in 2011, and a Republican in 2012. In 1987, Trump placed full-page advertisements in three major newspapers, advocating peace in Central America, accelerated nuclear disarmament talks with the Soviet Union, and reduction of the federal budget deficit by making American allies pay "their fair share" for military defense. He ruled out running for local office but not for the presidency. 2000 presidential campaign and 2011 hints at presidential run  Trump speaking at ||Conservative_Political_Action_Conference|| 2011 In 2000, Trump ||Donald_Trump_2000_presidential_campaign|| for nomination as the Reform Party candidate for the ||2000_United_States_presidential_election|| but withdrew from the race in February 2000. A July 1999 poll matching him against likely Republican nominee ||George_W._Bush|| and likely Democratic nominee ||Al_Gore|| showed Trump with seven percent support. In 2011, Trump ||Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories#Donald_Trump|| against President Barack Obama in ||2012_United_States_presidential_election||, making his first speaking appearance at the ||Conservative_Political_Action_Conference|| (CPAC) in February 2011 and giving speeches in early primary states. In May 2011, he announced he would not run, and he endorsed ||Mitt_Romney|| in February 2012. Trump's presidential ambitions were generally not taken seriously at the time. 2016 presidential campaign Main article: ||Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign|| Trump's fame and provocative statements earned him an unprecedented amount of ||Earned_media||, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries. He adopted the phrase "truthful hyperbole", coined by his ghostwriter Tony Schwartz, to describe his public speaking style. His campaign statements were often opaque and suggestive, and a record number of them were false. The Los Angeles Times wrote, "Never in modern presidential politics has a major candidate made false statements as routinely as Trump has." Trump said he disdained ||Political_correctness|| and frequently made claims of ||Media_bias||.  Republican primaries Main article: ||2016_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries||  Trump campaigning in Arizona, March 2016. Trump announced his candidacy in June 2015. His campaign was initially not taken seriously by political analysts, but he quickly rose to the top of opinion polls. He became the front-runner in March 2016. After a landslide win in ||Indiana_Republican_primary,_2016|| in May, Trump was declared the presumptive Republican nominee. General election campaign Main article: ||2016_United_States_presidential_election#General_election_campaign|| ||Hillary_Clinton|| led Trump in ||Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_United_States_presidential_election,_2016|| throughout the campaign but in early July her lead narrowed. In mid-July Trump selected Indiana governor ||Mike_Pence|| as his vice presidential running mate, and the two were officially nominated at the Republican National Convention. Trump and Clinton faced off in ||2016_United_States_presidential_debates|| in September and October 2016. Trump twice refused to say whether he would accept the result of the election. Campaign rhetoric and political positions Main article: ||Political_positions_of_Donald_Trump|| Trump's political positions and rhetoric were ||Right-wing_populism||. ||Politico|| described them as "eclectic, improvisational and often contradictory", quoting a health care policy expert at the ||American_Enterprise_Institute|| as saying that his political positions were "a total random assortment of whatever plays publicly." while NBC News counted "141 distinct shifts on 23 major issues" during his campaign. Trump helped bring far-right fringe ideas, beliefs, and organizations into the mainstream, pandered to white supremacists, retweeted racist Twitter accounts, and repeatedly refused to condemn ||David_Duke||, the ||Ku_Klux_Klan|| (KKK) or white supremacists. After a public uproar, he disavowed Duke and the KKK. In August 2016, he appointed ||Steve_Bannon||, the executive chairman of ||Breitbart_News||—described by Bannon as "the platform for the alt-right"—as his campaign CEO. Trump's campaign platform emphasized renegotiating ||China%E2%80%93United_States_relations|| and free trade agreements such as ||NAFTA|| and the ||Trans-Pacific_Partnership||, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building ||Trump_wall|| along the U.S.–Mexico border. Other campaign positions included pursuing ||Energy_independence|| while opposing climate change regulations such as the ||Clean_Power_Plan|| and the ||Paris_Agreement||, modernizing and expediting ||United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs#Veterans_Benefits_Administration||, repealing and replacing the ||Affordable_Care_Act||, abolishing ||Common_Core|| education standards, ||Infrastructure-based_development||, simplifying the ||Internal_Revenue_Code|| while reducing taxes for all economic classes, and imposing ||Tariff|| on imports by companies that offshore jobs. He advocated a largely ||United_States_non-interventionism|| approach to foreign policy while increasing military spending, extreme vetting or banning immigrants from Muslim-majority countries to pre-empt domestic Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against the ||Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant||. He described ||NATO|| as "obsolete". Support from the far-right The ||Alt-right|| movement coalesced around and supported Trump's candidacy, due in part to its ||Opposition_to_multiculturalism|| and ||Opposition_to_immigration||. Duke enthusiastically supported Trump and said he and like-minded people voted for Trump because of his promises to "take our country back". In an interview after the election, Trump said that he did not want to "energize the group" and that he disavowed them. Financial disclosures Trump's FEC-required reports listed assets above $1.4 billion and outstanding debts of at least $315 million. Trump did not release ||Donald_Trump%27s_tax_returns||, contrary to the practice of every major candidate since 1976 and his promises in 2014 and 2015 to do so if he ran for office. He said his tax returns were being ||Income_tax_audit||, and his lawyers had advised him against releasing them. After a lengthy court battle to block release of his tax returns and other records to the ||New_York_County_District_Attorney|| for a criminal investigation, including two appeals by Trump to the ||United_States_Supreme_Court||, in February 2021 the high court allowed the records to be released to the prosecutor for review by a grand jury. In October 2016, portions of Trump's state filings for 1995 were leaked to a reporter from The New York Times. They show that Trump had declared a loss of $916 million that year, which could have let him avoid taxes for up to 18 years. Election to the presidency Main article: ||2016_United_States_presidential_election||  2016 electoral vote results. Trump won 304–227 On November 8, 2016, Trump received 306 pledged ||Electoral_College_(United_States)|| versus 232 for Clinton. The official counts were 304 and 227 respectively, after ||Faithless_electors_in_the_United_States_presidential_election,_2016||. Trump received nearly 2.9 million fewer popular votes than Clinton, which made him the fifth person to be elected president ||United_States_presidential_elections_in_which_the_winner_lost_the_popular_vote||. Trump's victory was a political upset. Polls had consistently shown Clinton with a ||Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_2016_United_States_presidential_election||—though diminishing—lead, as well as an advantage in most of the ||Statewide_opinion_polling_for_the_2016_United_States_presidential_election||. Trump's support had been modestly underestimated, while Clinton's had been overestimated. Trump won 30 states; included were ||Michigan||, ||Pennsylvania||, and ||Wisconsin||, which had been part of what was considered a ||Blue_wall_(politics)|| of Democratic strongholds since the 1990s. Clinton won 20 states and the ||District_of_Columbia||. Trump's victory marked the return of an ||Divided_government_in_the_United_States|| Republican government—a Republican White House combined with Republican control of both chambers of ||United_States_Congress||. Trump was the ||List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_by_age|| as president at the time of his inauguration. He is also ||List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_by_previous_experience|| who did not serve in the military or hold any government office prior to becoming president.  ||2017_Women%27s_March|| in Washington on January 21, 2017 Trump's election victory sparked ||Protests_against_Donald_Trump||. On the day after Trump's inauguration, an estimated 2.6 million people worldwide, including an estimated half million in Washington, D.C., protested against Trump in the ||2017_Women%27s_March||. Marches against his ||Executive_Order_13769|| began across the country on January 29, 2017, just nine days after his inauguration. Presidency (2017–2021) Main article: ||Presidency_of_Donald_Trump|| For a chronological guide to this subject, see ||Timeline_of_the_Donald_Trump_presidency||. Early actions See also: ||Presidential_transition_of_Donald_Trump|| and ||First_100_days_of_Donald_Trump%27s_presidency||  Trump is ||Inauguration_of_Donald_Trump|| as president by Chief Justice ||John_Roberts|| ||Inauguration_of_Donald_Trump|| as the 45th president of the United States on January 20, 2017. During his first week in office, he signed ||List_of_executive_actions_by_Donald_Trump#Executive_orders||: interim procedures in anticipation of repealing the Affordable Care Act ("Obamacare"), withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, reinstatement of the ||Mexico_City_policy||, authorizing the ||Keystone_Pipeline|| and ||Dakota_Access_Pipeline|| construction projects, reinforcing border security, and beginning the planning and design process to construct a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. Trump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law ||Jared_Kushner|| became his ||Assistant_to_the_President|| and ||Senior_Advisor_to_the_President_of_the_United_States||, respectively. Conflicts of interest Before being inaugurated, Trump moved his businesses into a ||Revocable_trust|| run by his sons, Eric and Donald Jr, and a business associate. However Trump continued to profit from his businesses and continued to have knowledge of how his administration's policies affected his businesses. Though Trump said he would eschew "new foreign deals", the Trump Organization pursued expansions of its operations in Dubai, Scotland, and the Dominican Republic. Trump was sued for violating the ||Domestic_Emoluments_Clause|| and ||Foreign_Emoluments_Clause|| of the ||U.S._Constitution||, marking the first time that the clauses had been substantively litigated. The plaintiffs said that Trump's business interests could allow foreign governments to influence him. Trump called the clause "phony". After Trump's term had ended, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the cases as moot. Domestic policy Economy Main article: ||Economic_policy_of_Donald_Trump|| See also: ||Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act_of_2017|| Trump took office at the height of the longest ||Economic_expansion|| in American history, which began in June 2009 and continued until February 2020, when the ||COVID-19_recession|| began. In December 2017, Trump signed the ||Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act_of_2017||. The bill had been passed by both Republican-controlled chambers of Congress without any Democratic votes. It reduced tax rates for businesses and individuals, with business tax cuts to be permanent and individual tax cuts set to expire after 2025, and eliminated the ||Affordable_Care_Act||'s individual requirement to obtain health insurance. The Trump administration claimed that the act would either increase tax revenues or pay for itself by prompting economic growth. Instead, revenues in 2018 were 7.6% lower than projected.  Trump speaks to automobile workers in Michigan, March 2017 Despite a campaign promise to eliminate the national debt in eight years, Trump approved large increases in government spending and the 2017 tax cut. As a result, the federal budget deficit increased by almost 50 percent, to nearly $1 trillion in 2019. Under Trump, the ||U.S._national_debt|| increased by 39 percent, reaching $27.75 trillion by the end of his term; the U.S. ||Debt-to-GDP_ratio|| also hit a post-World War II high. Trump also failed to deliver the $1 trillion infrastructure spending plan he had campaigned on. Trump was the only modern U.S. president to leave office with a smaller workforce, by 3 million, than when he took office. Energy and climate Main articles: ||Environmental_policy_of_the_Donald_Trump_administration|| and ||Climate_change_in_the_United_States|| Trump rejects the ||Scientific_consensus_on_climate_change||. He reduced the budget for renewable energy research by 40% and reversed Obama-era policies directed at curbing climate change. In June 2017, Trump announced the ||Withdrawal_of_the_United_States_from_the_Paris_Agreement||, making the U.S. the only nation in the world to not ratify the agreement. Trump rolled back more than 100 federal environmental regulations, including those that curbed ||Greenhouse_gas_emissions||, air and water pollution, and the use of toxic substances. He weakened protections for animals and environmental standards for federal infrastructure projects, and expanded permitted areas for drilling and resource extraction, such as allowing ||Arctic_Refuge_drilling_controversy||. Trump aimed to boost the production and exports of ||Fossil_fuel||; under Trump, natural gas expanded, but coal continued to decline. Deregulation On January 30, 2017, Trump signed ||Executive_Order_13771||, which directed that for every new regulation administrative agencies issue "at least two prior regulations be identified for elimination". Agency defenders expressed opposition to Trump's criticisms, saying the bureaucracy exists to protect people against well-organized, well-funded interest groups. Trump ||Deregulation|| on health, labor, and the environment, among other topics. Trump signed 14 ||Congressional_Review_Act|| resolutions repealing federal regulations, among them a bill that made it easier for severely mentally ill persons to buy guns. During his first six weeks in office, he delayed, suspended or reversed ninety federal regulations, often "made after requests by the regulated industries." Health care During his campaign, Trump vowed to ||Efforts_to_repeal_the_Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act|| and replace the Affordable Care Act. In May 2017, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed a ||American_Health_Care_Act_of_2017|| in a party-line vote but repeal proposals were narrowly voted down in the Senate after three Republicans joined all Democrats in opposing it. Trump scaled back the implementation of the ACA through ||Executive_Order_13765|| and ||Executive_Order_13813||. Trump expressed a desire to "let Obamacare fail"; his administration cut the ACA ||Annual_enrollment|| in half and drastically reduced funding for advertising and other ways to encourage enrollment. The ||Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act_of_2017|| signed by Trump effectively repealed the ACA's ||Individual_shared_responsibility_provision|| in 2019, and a budget bill Trump signed in 2019 repealed the ||Cadillac_insurance_plan||. Trump falsely claimed he saved the coverage of pre-existing conditions provided by the ACA; in fact, the Trump administration ||California_v._Texas|| seeking to strike down the entire ACA, including protections for those with pre-existing conditions. If the lawsuit had succeeded, it would have eliminated ||Health_insurance_coverage_in_the_United_States|| for up to 23 million Americans. During the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to protect funding for Medicare and other social safety-net programs, but in January 2020 he suggested he was willing to consider cuts to such programs. Trump's policies in response to the ||Opioid_epidemic_in_the_United_States|| were widely criticized as ineffectual and harmful. U.S. opioid overdose deaths declined slightly in 2018, but surged to a new record of 50,052 deaths in 2019. Social issues Main article: ||Social_policy_of_Donald_Trump|| Trump said in 2016 that he was committed to appointing "||Pro-life||" justices, pledging to appoint justices who would "automatically" overturn ||Roe_v._Wade||. He also said he supported "traditional marriage" but considered the ||Same-sex_marriage_in_the_United_States|| of ||Same-sex_marriage|| a "settled" issue; in March 2017, his administration rolled back key components of the Obama administration's workplace protections against discrimination of LGBT people. Trump said he is ||Gun_politics_in_the_United_States|| to ||Gun_control|| in general, although his views have shifted over time. After several ||Mass_shootings_in_the_United_States|| during his term, he said he would propose legislation to curtail gun violence, but this was abandoned in November 2019. His administration took an ||Cannabis_policy_of_the_Donald_Trump_administration||, revoking ||Cole_Memorandum|| that provided protections for states that legalized marijuana. Under Trump, the ||Capital_punishment_by_the_United_States_federal_government|| 13 prisoners, more than in the previous 56 years combined and after a 17-year moratorium. In 2016, Trump said he supported the use of interrogation torture methods such as ||Waterboarding|| but later appeared to recant this due to the opposition of Defense Secretary ||James_Mattis||. Pardons and commutations Main article: ||List_of_people_granted_executive_clemency_by_Donald_Trump|| Most of Trump's pardons and commutations were granted to people with personal or political connections to him. In his term, Trump sidestepped ||Office_of_the_Pardon_Attorney||; instead he often entertained pardon requests from his associates or from celebrities. From 2017 to 2019, the pardons included former Arizona sheriff ||Joe_Arpaio||; former Navy sailor ||Kristian_Saucier||, who was convicted of taking classified photographs of classified areas inside a submarine; and conservative commentator ||Dinesh_D%27Souza||. Following a request by celebrity ||Kim_Kardashian||, Trump commuted the life sentence of ||Alice_Marie_Johnson||, who had been convicted of drug trafficking. Trump pardoned or reversed the sentences of three American servicemen convicted or accused of committing war crimes in Afghanistan or Iraq. In November and December 2020, Trump pardoned four ||Academi|| ||Private_military_company|| convicted of killing Iraqi civilians in the 2007 ||Nisour_Square_massacre||; white-collar criminals ||Michael_Milken|| and ||Bernard_Kerik||; and daughter Ivanka's father-in-law ||Charles_Kushner||. He also pardoned five people convicted as a result of investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections: Michael Flynn, ||George_Papadopoulos||, ||Alex_van_der_Zwaan||, Roger Stone, whose 40-month sentence for lying to Congress, witness tampering, and obstruction he had already commuted in July, and Paul Manafort. In his last full day in office, Trump granted 143 pardons and commutations; those receiving pardons include Steve Bannon, Trump fundraiser ||Elliott_Broidy|| and three former Republican congressmen. Amongst those to receive sentence commutation were former Detroit mayor and Democrat ||Kwame_Kilpatrick|| and sports gambler ||Billy_Walters_(gambler)||; the latter had paid tens of thousands of dollars to former Trump attorney ||John_M._Dowd|| to plead his case with Trump. Lafayette Square protester removal and photo op Main article: ||Donald_Trump_photo_op_at_St._John%27s_Church||  Trump and group of officials and advisors on the way from White House complex to St. John's Church On June 1, 2020, federal law enforcement officials used batons, rubber bullets, ||Pepper_spray|| projectiles, ||Stun_grenade||, and smoke to remove a largely peaceful crowd of protesters from ||Lafayette_Square,_Washington,_D.C.||, outside the ||White_House||. Trump then walked to ||St._John%27s_Episcopal_Church,_Lafayette_Square||, where protesters had set a small fire the night before; he posed for photographs holding a Bible, with senior administration officials later joining him in photos. Trump said on June 3 that the protesters were cleared because "they tried to burn down the church [on May 31] and almost succeeded", describing the church as "badly hurt". Religious leaders condemned the treatment of protesters and the photo opportunity itself. Many retired military leaders and defense officials condemned Trump's proposal to use the U.S. military against anti-police brutality protesters. The chairman of the ||Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff||, General ||Mark_A._Milley||, later apologized for accompanying Trump on the walk and thereby "creat[ing] the perception of the military involved in domestic politics". Immigration Main article: ||Immigration_policy_of_Donald_Trump|| Trump's proposed immigration policies were a topic of bitter and contentious debate during the campaign. He promised to build ||Mexico%E2%80%93United_States_barrier|| on the ||Mexico%E2%80%93United_States_border|| to restrict illegal movement and vowed Mexico would pay for it. He pledged to deport millions of ||Illegal_immigrant_population_of_the_United_States||, and criticized ||Birthright_citizenship_in_the_United_States|| for incentivizing "||Anchor_babies||". As president, he frequently described illegal immigration as an "invasion" and conflated immigrants with the criminal gang ||MS-13||, though research shows undocumented immigrants have a lower crime rate than native-born Americans. Trump attempted to drastically escalate immigration enforcement, including implementing harsher immigration enforcement policies against asylum seekers from Central America than any modern U.S. president. From 2018 onwards, Trump ||Operation_Faithful_Patriot||, to stop most Central American migrants from seeking U.S. asylum, and from 2020 used the ||Public_charge_rule|| to restrict immigrants using government benefits from getting permanent residency via ||Green_card||. Trump has reduced the number of ||United_States_Refugee_Admissions_Program|| into the U.S. to record lows. When Trump took office, the annual limit was 110,000; Trump set a limit of 18,000 in the 2020 fiscal year and 15,000 in the 2021 fiscal year. Additional restrictions implemented by the Trump administration caused significant bottlenecks in processing refugee applications, resulting in fewer refugees accepted compared to the allowed limits. Travel ban Main articles: ||Executive_Order_13769|| and ||Executive_Order_13780|| Following the ||2015_San_Bernardino_attack||, Trump proposed to ban Muslim foreigners from entering the United States until stronger vetting systems could be implemented. He later reframed the proposed ban to apply to countries with a "proven history of terrorism". On January 27, 2017, Trump signed ||Executive_Order_13769||, which suspended admission of refugees for 120 days and denied entry to citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days, citing security concerns. The order took effect immediately and without warning. Confusion and protests caused chaos at airports. ||Legal_challenges_to_Executive_Orders_13769_and_13780|| were filed against the order, and a federal judge ||National_injunctions||. On March 6, Trump issued ||Executive_Order_13780||, which excluded Iraq and gave other exemptions, but was again blocked by federal judges in three states. In a ||Int%27l_Refugee_Assistance_Project_v._Trump||, the ||Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States|| ruled that the ban could be enforced on visitors who lack a "credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States". The temporary order was replaced by ||Presidential_Proclamation_9645|| on September 24, 2017, which permanently restricts travel from the originally targeted countries except Iraq and Sudan, and further bans travelers from North Korea and Chad, along with certain Venezuelan officials. After lower courts partially blocked the new restrictions, the Supreme Court allowed the September version to go into full effect on December 4, 2017, and ultimately upheld the travel ban in a June 2019 ruling. Family separation at border Main article: ||Trump_administration_family_separation_policy|| Children sitting within a wire mesh compartment in the ||Ursula_(detention_center)|| in ||McAllen,_Texas||, June 2018 The Trump administration separated more than 5,400 children of migrant families from their parents at the U.S.–Mexico border while attempting to enter the U.S, a sharp increase in the number of family separations at the border starting from the summer of 2017. In April 2018, the Trump administration announced a "||Trump_administration_family_separation_policy||" policy whereby every adult suspected of ||Illegal_entry|| would be criminally prosecuted. This resulted in family separations, as the migrant adults were put in criminal detention for prosecution, while their children were separated as unaccompanied alien minors. Administration officials described the policy as a way to deter illegal immigration. The policy of family separations was unprecedented in previous administrations and sparked public outrage. Trump falsely asserted that his administration was merely following the law, blaming Democrats, despite the separations being his administration's policy. Although Trump originally argued that the separations could not be stopped by an executive order, he proceeded to sign an executive order on June 20, 2018, mandating that migrant families be detained together, unless the administration judged that doing so would harm the child. On June 26, 2018, a federal judge concluded that the Trump administration had "no system in place to keep track of" the separated children, nor any effective measures for family communication and reunification; the judge ordered for the families to be reunited, and family separations stopped, except in the cases where the parent(s) are judged unfit to take care of the child, or if there is parental approval. Despite the federal court order, the Trump administration continued to practice family separations, with more than a thousand migrant children separated. Trump wall and government shutdown Main articles: ||Trump_wall|| and ||2018%E2%80%932019_United_States_federal_government_shutdown||  Trump examines border wall prototypes in ||Otay_Mesa,_California||. One of Trump's central campaign promises was to build a 1,000-mile border wall to Mexico and have Mexico pay for it. By the end of his term, the U.S. had built "40 miles of new primary wall and 33 miles of secondary wall" in locations where there had been no barriers and 365 miles of primary or secondary border fencing replacing dilapidated or outdated barriers. In 2018, Trump refused to extend government funding unless Congress allocated $5.6 billion in funds for the border wall, resulting in the federal government partially shutting down for 35 days from December 2018 to January 2019, the ||List_of_United_States_federal_funding_gaps||. Around 800,000 government employees were ||Furlough|| or worked without pay. Trump and Congress ended the shutdown by approving temporary funding that provided delayed payments to government workers but no funds for the wall. The shutdown resulted in an estimated permanent loss of $3 billion to the economy, according to the ||Congressional_Budget_Office||. About half of those polled blamed Trump for the shutdown, and Trump's approval ratings dropped. To prevent another imminent shutdown in February 2019, Congress passed and Trump signed a funding bill that included $1.375 billion for 55 miles of bollard border fencing. Trump also declared a ||National_Emergency_Concerning_the_Southern_Border_of_the_United_States||, intending to divert $6.1 billion of funds Congress had allocated to other purposes. The House and the Senate attempted to block Trump's national emergency declaration, but there were not enough votes for a ||Veto_override||. Legal challenges of the fund diversions resulted in $2.5 billion of wall funding originally meant for the ||United_States_Department_of_Defense||'s drug interdiction efforts being approved and $3.6 billion originally meant for military construction being blocked. Foreign policy Main article: ||Foreign_policy_of_the_Donald_Trump_administration||  Trump with the other ||Group_of_Seven|| leaders at the ||45th_G7_summit|| in France, 2019 Trump described himself as a "nationalist" and his foreign policy as "||America_First_(policy)||". He espoused isolationist, ||Non-interventionism||, and protectionist views. His foreign policy was marked by praise and support of ||Populism||, ||Neo-nationalism|| and authoritarian governments. Hallmarks of foreign relations during Trump's tenure included unpredictability and uncertainty, a lack of a consistent foreign policy, and strained and sometimes antagonistic relationships with the U.S.'s European allies. Trump questioned the need for NATO, criticized the U.S.'s NATO allies, and privately suggested on multiple occasions that the United States should withdraw from the alliance. Trade See also: ||Trump_tariffs|| Trump is a skeptic of trade liberalization, adopting these views in the 1980s, and sharply criticized NAFTA during the Republican primary campaign in 2015. He withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations, imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and launched a ||China%E2%80%93United_States_trade_war|| by sharply increasing tariffs on 818 categories (worth $50 billion) of Chinese goods imported into the U.S. On several occasions, Trump said incorrectly that these import tariffs are paid by China into the ||U.S._Treasury||. Although he pledged during the campaign to significantly reduce the U.S.'s large ||Trade_deficits||, the deficit reached its highest level in 12 years under his administration. Following a 2017–2018 renegotiation, the ||United_States-Mexico-Canada_Agreement|| (USMCA) became effective in July 2020 as the successor to NAFTA. China  Trump and ||Xi_Jinping|| at 2018 G20 Summit. Before and during his presidency, Trump repeatedly accused China of taking unfair advantage of the U.S. As president, Trump ||China%E2%80%93United_States_trade_war|| that was widely characterized as a failure; sanctioned ||Huawei|| for its alleged ties to Iran; significantly increased visa restrictions on Chinese students and scholars; and classified China as a ||Currency_manipulator||. Trump also juxtaposed verbal attacks on China with praise of ||Chinese_Communist_Party|| ||Leader_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party|| ||Xi_Jinping||, which was attributed to trade war negotiations with the leader. After initially praising China for its handling of the ||COVID-19_pandemic||, he began a campaign of criticism over its response starting in March. Trump said he resisted punishing China for its ||Human_rights_in_China|| against ethnic minorities in the northwestern ||Xinjiang|| region for fear of jeopardizing trade negotiations. In July 2020, ||United_States_sanctions|| and visa restrictions against senior Chinese officials, in response to expanded mass ||Xinjiang_re-education_camps|| holding more than a million of the country's ||Uyghurs|| ||Islam_in_China|| ethnic minority. Saudi Arabia  Trump, King ||Salman_of_Saudi_Arabia||, and Egyptian president ||Abdel_Fattah_el-Sisi|| at the ||2017_Riyadh_summit|| in Saudi Arabia Trump actively supported the ||Saudi_Arabian-led_intervention_in_Yemen|| against the ||Houthis|| and in 2017 signed a $110 billion agreement to sell arms to Saudi Arabia, In 2018, the USA provided limited intelligence and logistical support for the intervention. Following the ||Abqaiq%E2%80%93Khurais_attack||, which the U.S. and Saudi Arabia blamed on Iran, Trump approved the deployment of 3,000 additional U.S. troops, including fighter squadrons, two Patriot batteries, and a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system (THAAD), to Saudi Arabia and the ||United_Arab_Emirates||. Israel Trump supported many of the policies of Israeli Prime Minister ||Benjamin_Netanyahu||. Under Trump, the U.S. ||United_States_recognition_of_Jerusalem_as_capital_of_Israel|| and ||United_States_recognition_of_the_Golan_Heights_as_part_of_Israel|| over the ||Golan_Heights||, leading to international condemnation including from the ||United_Nations_General_Assembly||, the ||European_Union|| and the ||Arab_League||. Afghanistan  U.S. Secretary of State ||Mike_Pompeo|| meeting with Taliban delegation in ||Qatar|| in September 2020 U.S. troop numbers in ||Afghanistan|| increased from 8,500 in January 2017 to 14,000 a year later, reversing Trump's pre-election position critical of further involvement in Afghanistan. In February 2020, the Trump administration signed a conditional ||Afghan_peace_process||, which called for the ||Withdrawal_of_United_States_troops_from_Afghanistan_(2021)|| in 14 months "contingent on a guarantee from the Taliban that Afghan soil will not be used by terrorists with aims to attack the United States or its allies" and for the U.S. to seek the release of 5,000 Taliban imprisoned by the Afghan government. By the end of Trump's term, 5,000 Taliban had been released, and, despite the Taliban continuing attacks on Afghan forces and integrating ||Al-Qaeda|| members into its leadership, U.S. troops had been reduced to 2,500. Syria Trump ordered ||2017_Shayrat_missile_strike|| and ||2018_missile_strikes_against_Syria|| against the Assad regime in Syria, in retaliation for the ||Khan_Shaykhun_chemical_attack|| and ||Douma_chemical_attack||, respectively. In December 2018, Trump declared "we have won against ISIS," contradicting Department of Defense assessments, and ordered the withdrawal of all troops from Syria. The next day, Mattis resigned in protest, calling his decision an abandonment of the U.S.'s ||Rojava|| who played a key role in fighting ISIS. One week after his announcement, Trump said he would not approve any extension of the American deployment in Syria. In October 2019, after Trump spoke to Turkish president ||Recep_Tayyip_Erdo%C4%9Fan||, ||American-led_intervention_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War|| were withdrawn from the area, and Turkey ||2019_Turkish_offensive_into_north-eastern_Syria||, attacking and ||Forced_displacement|| American-allied ||Kurds_in_Syria|| in the area. Later that month, the U.S. House of Representatives, in a rare bipartisan vote of 354 to 60, condemned Trump's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, for "abandoning U.S. allies, undermining the struggle against ISIS, and spurring a humanitarian catastrophe". Iran After an Iranian missile test on January 29, 2017, and Houthi attacks on Saudi warships, the Trump administration sanctioned 12 companies and 13 individuals suspected of being involved in Iran's missile program. In May 2018, Trump ||United_States_withdrawal_from_the_Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action|| from the ||Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action|| (JCPOA), the 2015 agreement between Iran, the U.S., and five other countries that lifted most economic sanctions against Iran in return for Iran agreeing to restrictions on its nuclear program. Analysts determined Iran moved closer to developing a nuclear weapon since the withdrawal. In January 2020, Trump ordered ||Assassination_of_Qasem_Soleimani|| that killed Iranian general and ||Quds_Force|| commander ||Qasem_Soleimani||, Iraqi ||Popular_Mobilization_Forces|| commander ||Abu_Mahdi_al-Muhandis||, and eight other people. Trump publicly threatened to attack Iranian cultural sites, or react "in a disproportionate manner" if Iran retaliated. Several days later, Iran retaliated with a ballistic missile strike against two U.S. airbases in Iraq and accidentally shot down ||Ukraine_International_Airlines_Flight_752|| after takeoff from Tehran airport. Trump downplayed the severity of the missile strike and the brain injuries sustained by service members, denying them ||Purple_Heart|| awards. In August 2020, the Trump administration unsuccessfully attempted to trigger a mechanism that was part of the agreement and would have led to the return of U.N. sanctions against Iran. North Korea  Trump meets ||Kim_Jong-un|| at ||2018_North_Korea%E2%80%93United_States_Singapore_Summit||, June 2018 In 2017, when ||North_Korea%27s_nuclear_weapons|| were increasingly seen as a serious threat, Trump escalated his rhetoric, warning that North Korean aggression would be met with "fire and fury like the world has never seen". In 2017, Trump declared that he wanted North Korea's "complete denuclearization", and engaged in ||Name-calling|| with leader ||Kim_Jong-un||. After this period of tension, Trump and Kim exchanged at least 27 letters in which the two men described a warm personal friendship. Trump met Kim three times: ||2018_North_Korea%E2%80%93United_States_Singapore_Summit|| in 2018, ||2019_North_Korea%E2%80%93United_States_Hanoi_Summit|| in 2019, and ||2019_Koreas%E2%80%93United_States_DMZ_Summit|| in 2019. Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to meet a North Korean leader or to set foot on North Korean soil. Trump also lifted some U.S. ||Sanctions_against_North_Korea||. However, no denuclearization agreement was reached, and talks in October 2019 broke down after one day. While conducting no nuclear tests since 2017, North Korea continued to build up its arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. Russia  Putin and Trump shaking hands at the ||2019_G20_Osaka_summit||, June 2019 Trump repeatedly praised and rarely criticized Russian president ||Vladimir_Putin||, but opposed some actions of the Russian government. The Trump administration "water[ed] down the toughest penalties the U.S. had imposed on Russian entities" after its ||2014_annexation_of_Crimea||. Trump also supported a potential return of Russia to the ||G7|| and never brought up Russia's alleged ||Russian_bounty_program|| with Putin. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the ||Intermediate-Range_Nuclear_Forces_Treaty||, citing alleged Russian non-compliance. After he met Putin at the ||2018_Russia%E2%80%93United_States_summit|| in July 2018, Trump drew bipartisan criticism for accepting Putin's denial of ||Russian_interference_in_the_2016_presidential_election||, rather than accepting the findings of U.S. intelligence agencies. Personnel Main articles: ||Political_appointments_by_Donald_Trump|| and ||Cabinet_of_Donald_Trump|| See also: ||Speculation_about_Donald_Trump%27s_Cabinet|| The Trump administration had a high turnover of personnel, particularly among White House staff. By the end of Trump's first year in office, 34 percent of his original staff had resigned, been fired, or been reassigned. As of early July 2018, 61 percent of Trump's senior aides had left and 141 staffers had left in the previous year. Both figures set a record for recent presidents—more change in the first 13 months than his four immediate predecessors saw in their first two years. Notable early departures included National Security Advisor Michael Flynn (after just 25 days in office), and Press Secretary ||Sean_Spicer||. Close personal aides to Trump including Steve Bannon, ||Hope_Hicks||, ||John_McEntee_(political_aide)||, and ||Keith_Schiller|| quit or were forced out. Some, including Hicks and McEntee, later returned to the White House in different posts. Trump publicly disparaged several of his former top officials, calling them incompetent, stupid, or crazy. Trump had four ||White_House_chiefs_of_staff||, marginalizing or pushing out several. ||Reince_Priebus|| was replaced after seven months by retired Marine general ||John_F._Kelly||. Kelly resigned in December 2018 after a tumultuous tenure in which his influence waned, and Trump subsequently disparaged him. Kelly was succeeded by ||Mick_Mulvaney|| as acting chief of staff; he was replaced in March 2020 by ||Mark_Meadows_(North_Carolina_politician)||. On May 9, 2017, Trump ||Dismissal_of_James_Comey||. While initially attributing this action to Comey's conduct in the investigation about ||Hillary_Clinton_email_controversy#October_2016_–_Additional_investigation||, Trump said a few days later that he was concerned with Comey's roles in the ongoing Trump-Russia investigations, and that he had intended to fire Comey earlier. At a private conversation in February, Trump said he hoped Comey would drop the investigation into National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. In March and April, Trump asked Comey to "lift the cloud impairing his ability to act" by saying publicly that the FBI was not investigating him. Two of Trump's 15 original Cabinet members were gone within 15 months: ||Health_and_Human_Services_Secretary|| ||Tom_Price_(American_politician)|| was forced to resign in September 2017 due to excessive use of private charter jets and military aircraft, and Trump replaced Tillerson as Secretary of State with ||Mike_Pompeo|| in March 2018 over disagreements on foreign policy. In 2018, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and Interior Secretary ||Ryan_Zinke|| resigned amid multiple investigations into their conduct. Trump was slow to appoint second-tier officials in the executive branch, saying many of the positions are unnecessary. In October 2017, there were still hundreds of sub-cabinet positions without a nominee. By January 8, 2019, of 706 key positions, 433 had been filled (61 percent) and Trump had no nominee for 264 (37 percent). Judiciary Main articles: ||List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_Donald_Trump||, ||Donald_Trump_judicial_appointment_controversies||, and ||Donald_Trump_Supreme_Court_candidates|| After Republicans won control of the U.S. Senate in 2014, only 28.6 percent of judicial nominees were confirmed, "the lowest percentage of confirmations from 1977 to 2018". At the end of the Obama presidency, 105 judgeships were vacant.  Trump and his third Supreme Court nominee, ||Amy_Coney_Barrett||. Trump appointed 226 ||United_States_federal_judge||, including 54 federal appellate judges. Senate Republicans, led by Senate Majority Leader ||Mitch_McConnell||, rapidly confirmed Trump's judicial appointees, ||Judicial_appointment_history_for_United_States_federal_courts||. The appointees were overwhelmingly white men and younger on average than the appointees of Trump's predecessors. Many were affiliated with the ||Federalist_Society||. Trump appointed three justices to the ||Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States||: ||Neil_Gorsuch||, ||Brett_Kavanaugh||, and ||Amy_Coney_Barrett||. In 2016, Senate Republicans had taken the unprecedented step of refusing to consider ||Merrick_Garland_Supreme_Court_nomination|| of ||Merrick_Garland|| to fill the vacancy left by the death of ||Antonin_Scalia|| in February 2016, arguing that the seat should not be filled in an election year. ||Neil_Gorsuch_Supreme_Court_nomination|| to the seat in 2017 in a mostly ||Party-line_vote|| of 54–45, after Republicans invoked the "||Nuclear_option||" (a historic change to Senate rules removing the 60-vote threshold for advancing Supreme Court nominations) to defeat a Democratic ||Filibuster||. ||Brett_Kavanaugh_Supreme_Court_nomination|| in 2018 to replace retiring Justice ||Anthony_Kennedy||; the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh in a mostly party-line vote of 50–48, after a bitter confirmation battle centered on ||Christine_Blasey_Ford||'s allegation that Kavanaugh had attempted to rape her when they were teenagers, which Kavanaugh denied. Five weeks before the November 2020 election, ||Amy_Coney_Barrett_Supreme_Court_nomination|| Amy Coney Barrett to fill the vacancy left by ||Death_and_state_funeral_of_Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg|| of Justice ||Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg||. Eight days before the election, after 60 million Americans had already voted, Senate Republicans confirmed Barrett to the Supreme Court without any Democratic votes. Many observers strongly criticized the confirmation, arguing that it was a gross violation of the precedent Republicans set in 2016. As president, Trump disparaged courts and judges whom he disagreed with, often in personal terms, and questioned the judiciary's constitutional authority. Trump's attacks on the courts have drawn rebukes from observers, including sitting federal judges, who are concerned about the effect of Trump's statements on the ||Judicial_independence|| and public confidence in the judiciary. COVID-19 pandemic Main articles: ||COVID-19_pandemic||, ||COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States||, ||U.S._federal_government_response_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic||, ||Trump_administration_communication_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic||, and ||Economic_impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States|| In December 2019, ||Coronavirus_disease_2019|| erupted in ||Wuhan||, China; the ||Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2|| spread worldwide within weeks. The first confirmed case in the U.S. was reported on January 20, 2020. The outbreak was officially declared a public health emergency by ||United_States_Secretary_of_Health_and_Human_Services|| ||Alex_Azar|| on January 31, 2020. Trump's public statements on COVID-19 were at odds with his private statements. In February 2020 Trump publicly asserted that the outbreak in the U.S. was less deadly than influenza, was "very much under control", and would soon be over. At the same time he acknowledged the opposite in a private conversation with ||Bob_Woodward||. In March 2020, Trump privately told Woodward that he was deliberately "playing it down" in public so as not to create panic. Initial response Trump was slow to address the spread of the disease, initially dismissing the imminent threat and ignoring persistent public health warnings and calls for action from health officials within his administration and Secretary Azar. Instead, throughout January and February he focused on economic and political considerations of the outbreak. By mid-March, most global financial markets had ||2020_stock_market_crash|| in response to the emerging pandemic. Trump continued to claim that a vaccine was months away, although HHS and ||Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention|| (CDC) officials had repeatedly told him that ||COVID-19_vaccine|| would take 12–18 months. Trump also falsely claimed that "anybody that wants a test can get a test," despite the availability of tests being severely limited. On March 6, Trump signed the ||Coronavirus_Preparedness_and_Response_Supplemental_Appropriations_Act|| into law, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies. On March 11, the ||World_Health_Organization|| (WHO) recognized the spread of COVID-19 as a ||Pandemic||, and Trump announced partial travel restrictions for most of Europe, effective March 13. That same day, he gave his first serious assessment of the virus in a nationwide Oval Office address, calling the outbreak "horrible" but "a temporary moment" and saying there was no financial crisis. On March 13, he declared a ||State_of_emergency||, freeing up federal resources. In September 2019, the Trump administration terminated ||United_States_Agency_for_International_Development||'s ||PREDICT_(USAID)|| program, a $200 million ||Epidemiological|| research program initiated in 2009 to provide early warning of pandemics abroad. The program trained scientists in sixty foreign laboratories to detect and respond to viruses that have the potential to cause pandemics. One such laboratory was the Wuhan lab that first identified the virus that causes COVID-19. After revival in April 2020, the program was given two 6-month extensions to help fight COVID-19 in the U.S. and other countries. On April 22, Trump signed an executive order restricting some forms of ||Immigration_to_the_United_States||. In late spring and early summer, with infections and death counts continuing to rise, he adopted a strategy of blaming the states for the growing pandemic, rather than accepting that his initial assessments of the course of the pandemic were overly-optimistic or his failure to provide presidential leadership. White House Coronavirus Task Force  Trump conducts a COVID-19 press briefing with members of the ||White_House_Coronavirus_Task_Force|| on March 15, 2020 Trump established the ||White_House_Coronavirus_Task_Force|| on January 29, 2020. Beginning in mid-March, Trump held a daily task force press conference, joined by medical experts and other administration officials, sometimes disagreeing with them by promoting unproven treatments. Trump was the main speaker at the briefings, where he praised his own response to the pandemic, frequently criticized rival presidential candidate Joe Biden, and denounced the press. On March 16, he acknowledged for the first time that the pandemic was not under control and that months of disruption to daily lives and a recession might occur. His repeated use of the terms "Chinese virus" and "China virus" to describe COVID-19 drew criticism from health experts. By early April, as the pandemic worsened and amid criticism of his administration's response, Trump refused to admit any mistakes in his handling of the outbreak, instead blaming the media, Democratic state governors, the previous administration, China, and the WHO. By mid-April 2020, some national news agencies began limiting live coverage of his daily press briefings, with ||The_Washington_Post|| reporting that "||Propaganda|| and false statements from Trump alternate with newsworthy pronouncements from members of his White House Coronavirus Task Force, particularly coronavirus response coordinator ||Deborah_Birx|| and ||National_Institute_of_Allergy_and_Infectious_Diseases|| Director ||Anthony_S._Fauci||". The daily coronavirus task force briefings ended in late April, after a briefing at which Trump suggested the dangerous idea of injecting a disinfectant to treat COVID-19; the comment was widely condemned by medical professionals.  ||Poland||'s president ||Andrzej_Duda|| visited the ||White_House|| on June 24, 2020, the first foreign leader to do so since the start of the pandemic. In early May, Trump proposed the phase-out of the coronavirus task force and its replacement with another group centered on reopening the economy. Amid a backlash, Trump said the task force would "indefinitely" continue. By the end of May, the coronavirus task force's meetings were sharply reduced. World Health Organization Prior to the pandemic, Trump criticized the WHO and other international bodies, which he asserted were taking advantage of U.S. aid. His administration's proposed 2021 federal budget, released in February, proposed reducing WHO funding by more than half. In May and April, Trump accused the WHO of "severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus" and alleged without evidence that the organization was under Chinese control and had enabled the Chinese government's concealment of the origins of the pandemic. He then announced that he was withdrawing funding for the organization. Trump's criticisms and actions regarding the WHO were seen as attempts to distract attention from his own mishandling of the pandemic. In July 2020, Trump announced the formal withdrawal of the United States from the WHO effective July 2021. The decision was widely condemned by health and government officials as "short-sighted", "senseless", and "dangerous". Testing In June and July, Trump said several times that the U.S. would have fewer cases of coronavirus if it did less testing, that having a large number of reported cases "makes us look bad". The CDC guideline at the time was that any person exposed to the virus should be "quickly identified and tested" even if they are not showing symptoms, because asymptomatic people can still spread the virus. In August 2020 the CDC quietly lowered its recommendation for testing, advising that people who have been exposed to the virus, but are not showing symptoms, "do not necessarily need a test". The change in guidelines was made by HHS political appointees under Trump administration pressure, against the wishes of CDC scientists. The day after this ||Trump_administration_political_interference_with_science_agencies|| was reported, the testing guideline was changed back to its original recommendation, stressing that anyone who has been in contact with an infected person should be tested. Pressure to abandon pandemic mitigation measures In April 2020, Republican-connected groups organized ||Protests_in_the_United_States_over_responses_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic|| against the measures state governments were taking to combat the pandemic; Trump encouraged the protests on Twitter, even though the targeted states did not meet the Trump administration's own guidelines for reopening. In April 2020, he first supported, then later criticized, Georgia Governor ||Brian_Kemp||'s plan to reopen some nonessential businesses. Throughout the spring he increasingly pushed for ending the restrictions as a way to reverse the damage to the country's economy. Trump often refused to ||Face_masks_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic|| at public events, contrary to his own administration's April 2020 guidance that Americans should wear masks in public and despite nearly unanimous medical consensus that masks are important to preventing the spread of the virus. By June, Trump had said masks were a "double-edged sword"; ridiculed Biden for wearing masks; continually emphasized that mask-wearing was optional; and suggested that wearing a mask was a political statement against him personally. Trump's contradiction of medical recommendations weakened national efforts to mitigate the pandemic. Despite record numbers of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. from mid-June onward and an increasing percentage of positive test results, Trump largely continued to downplay the pandemic, including his false claim in early July 2020 that 99 percent of COVID-19 cases are "totally harmless". He also began insisting that all states should open schools to in-person education in the fall despite a July spike in reported cases. Political pressure on health agencies Main article: ||Trump_administration_political_interference_with_science_agencies|| Trump repeatedly pressured federal health agencies to take actions he favored, such as approving unproven treatments or speeding up the approval of vaccines. Trump administration political appointees at HHS sought to control CDC communications to the public that undermined Trump's claims that the pandemic was under control. CDC resisted many of the changes, but increasingly allowed HHS personnel to review articles and suggest changes before publication. Trump alleged without evidence that FDA scientists were part of a "||Deep_state||" opposing him, and delaying approval of vaccines and treatments to hurt him politically. Outbreak at the White House Main article: ||White_House_COVID-19_outbreak||  Trump boards helicopter for COVID-19 treatment on October 2, 2020  Trump discharged on October 5, 2020, from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center On October 2, 2020, Trump tweeted that he had tested positive for ||Coronavirus_disease_2019||. His wife, their son Barron, and numerous staff members and visitors also became infected. Later that day ||Donald_Trump%27s_COVID-19_infection|| at ||Walter_Reed_National_Military_Medical_Center||, reportedly due to labored breathing and a fever. He was treated with antiviral and experimental antibody drugs and a steroid. He returned to the White House on October 5, still struggling with the disease. During and after his treatment he continued to downplay the virus. In 2021, it was revealed that his condition had been far more serious; he had dangerously low blood oxygen levels, a high fever, and lung infiltrates, indicating a severe case of the disease. Effects on the 2020 presidential campaign By July 2020, Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic had become a major issue for the 2020 presidential election. Democratic challenger Joe Biden sought to make the pandemic the central issue of the election. Polls suggested voters blamed Trump for his pandemic response and disbelieved his rhetoric concerning the virus, with an ||Ipsos||/||ABC_News|| poll indicating 65 percent of respondents disapproved of his pandemic response. In the final months of the campaign, Trump repeatedly claimed that the U.S. was "rounding the turn" in managing the pandemic, despite increasing numbers of reported cases and deaths. A few days before the November 3 election, the United States reported more than 100,000 cases in a single day for the first time. Investigations After he assumed the presidency, Trump was the subject of increasing Justice Department and congressional scrutiny, with investigations covering his election campaign, transition, and inauguration, actions taken during his presidency, along with his ||The_Trump_Organization||, personal taxes, and ||Donald_J._Trump_Foundation||. There were 30 investigations of Trump, including ten federal criminal investigations, eight state and local investigations, and twelve Congressional investigations. Hush money payments Main article: ||Stormy_Daniels%E2%80%93Donald_Trump_scandal|| See also: ||Legal_affairs_of_Donald_Trump#Payments_related_to_alleged_affairs||, and ||Karen_McDougal#Alleged_affair_with_Donald_Trump|| During the 2016 presidential election campaign, ||American_Media,_Inc.|| (AMI), the parent company of the ||National_Enquirer||, and a company set up by Trump's attorney Michael Cohen paid ||Playboy|| model ||Karen_McDougal|| and ||Pornographic_film_actor|| ||Stormy_Daniels|| for keeping silent about their alleged affairs with Trump between 2006 and 2007. Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to breaking campaign finance laws, saying he had arranged both payments at the direction of Trump to influence the presidential election. Trump denied the affairs and claimed he was not aware of Cohen's payment to Daniels, but he reimbursed him in 2017. Federal prosecutors asserted that Trump had been involved in discussions regarding non-disclosure payments as early as 2014. Court documents showed that the FBI believed Trump was directly involved in the payment to Daniels, based on calls he had with Cohen in October 2016. Federal prosecutors closed the investigation in 2019, but the ||Manhattan_District_Attorney|| subpoenaed the Trump Organization and AMI for records related to the payments and Trump and the Trump Organization for eight years of tax returns. Investigations of Russian election interference Main article: ||Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections|| For a chronological guide to this subject, see ||Timeline_of_Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections||. See also: ||Senate_Intelligence_Committee_report_on_Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_presidential_election|| and ||Steele_dossier|| In January 2017, American intelligence agencies—the ||CIA||, the ||FBI||, and the ||NSA||, represented by the ||Director_of_National_Intelligence||—jointly stated with "||Analytic_confidence#Levels_of_analytic_confidence_in_national_security_reports||" that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election to favor the election of Trump. In March 2017, FBI Director ||James_Comey|| told Congress "the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts." The ||Links_between_Trump_associates_and_Russian_officials|| were widely reported by the press. One of Trump's campaign managers, ||Paul_Manafort||, worked from December 2004 to February 2010 to help pro-Russian politician ||Viktor_Yanukovych|| win the Ukrainian presidency. Other Trump associates, including former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and political consultant Roger Stone, were connected to Russian officials. Russian agents were overheard during the campaign saying they could use Manafort and Flynn to influence Trump. Members of Trump's campaign and later his White House staff, particularly Flynn, were in contact with Russian officials both before and after the November election. On December 29, 2016, Flynn talked with Russian Ambassador ||Sergey_Kislyak|| about sanctions that were imposed that same day; Flynn later resigned in the midst of controversy over whether he misled Pence. Trump told Kislyak and ||Sergei_Lavrov|| in May 2017 he was unconcerned about Russian interference in U.S. elections. Trump and his allies promoted ||Conspiracy_theories_related_to_the_Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal|| that Ukraine, rather than Russia, interfered in the 2016 election—which was also promoted by Russia to ||Frameup|| Ukraine. After the ||Democratic_National_Committee|| was hacked, Trump first claimed it withheld "its server" from the FBI (in actuality there were more than 140 servers, of which digital copies were given to the FBI); second, that ||CrowdStrike||, the company that investigated the servers, was Ukraine-based and Ukrainian-owned (in actuality, CrowdStrike is U.S.-based, with the largest owners being American companies); and third that "the server" was hidden in Ukraine. Members of the Trump administration spoke out against the conspiracy theories. FBI Crossfire Hurricane and 2017 counterintelligence investigations The ||Crossfire_Hurricane_(FBI_investigation)|| FBI investigation into possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign was launched in July 2016 during the campaign season. After Trump fired FBI director James Comey in May 2017, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump's personal and ||Business_projects_of_Donald_Trump_in_Russia||. Crossfire Hurricane was folded into the Mueller investigation, but deputy attorney general ||Rod_Rosenstein|| ended the other investigation while giving the bureau the false impression that Mueller would pursue it. Special counsel investigation Main articles: ||Special_Counsel_investigation_(2017%E2%80%932019)||, ||Mueller_report||, and ||Criminal_charges_brought_in_the_Special_Counsel_investigation_(2017%E2%80%932019)|| In May 2017, ||United_States_Deputy_Attorney_General|| Rod Rosenstein appointed ||Robert_Mueller||, a former ||Director_of_the_FBI||, ||Special_counsel|| for the ||United_States_Department_of_Justice|| (DOJ) ordering him to "examine 'any links and/or coordination between the Russian government' and the Trump campaign." He privately told Mueller to restrict the investigation to criminal matters "in connection with Russia’s 2016 election interference". The special counsel also investigated whether Trump's ||Dismissal_of_James_Comey|| as FBI director constituted obstruction of justice and the Trump campaign's possible ties to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, ||Turkey||, ||Qatar||, Israel, and China. Trump denied ||Collusion|| between his campaign and the Russian government. He sought to fire Mueller and shut down the investigation multiple times but backed down after his staff objected or after changing his mind. He bemoaned the recusal of Attorney General Sessions on Russia matters, stating that Sessions should have stopped the investigation. In March 2019, Mueller concluded his investigation and gave ||Mueller_report|| to Attorney General William Barr. Two days later, ||Barr_letter|| purporting to summarize the report's main conclusions. A federal court, as well as Mueller himself, said Barr had mischaracterized the investigation's conclusions, confusing the public. Trump repeatedly and falsely claimed that the investigation exonerated him; the Mueller report expressly stated that it did not exonerate him. A redacted version of the report was publicly released in April 2019. It found that Russia interfered in 2016 to favor Trump's candidacy and hinder Clinton's. Despite "numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign", the prevailing evidence "did not establish" that Trump campaign members conspired or coordinated with Russian interference. The report revealed sweeping Russian interference and detailed how Trump and his campaign welcomed and encouraged it, believing they would politically benefit. The report also detailed multiple acts of potential obstruction of justice by Trump, but opted not to make any "traditional prosecutorial judgment" on whether Trump broke the law, suggesting that Congress should make such a determination. Investigators decided they could not "apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes" as an ||Office_of_Legal_Counsel|| opinion stated that a sitting president could not be indicted, and investigators would not accuse him of a crime when he cannot clear his name in court. The report concluded that Congress, having the authority to take action against a president for wrongdoing, "may apply the obstruction laws". The House of Representatives subsequently launched an ||Impeachment_inquiry_against_Donald_Trump|| following the ||Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal||, but did not pursue an article of impeachment related to the Mueller investigation. Several Trump associates pleaded guilty or were convicted in connection with Mueller's investigation and related cases. Manafort, ||Trials_of_Paul_Manafort||, deputy campaign manager ||Rick_Gates_(political_consultant)||, foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos, and Michael Flynn. Trump's former attorney ||Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)|| pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump's 2016 attempts to reach a deal with Russia to build ||Trump_Tower_Moscow||. Cohen said he had made the false statements on behalf of Trump, who was identified as "Individual-1" in the court documents. In February 2020, Trump campaign adviser ||Roger_Stone|| was sentenced to 40 months in prison for lying to Congress and witness tampering regarding his attempts to learn more about hacked Democratic emails during the 2016 election. The sentencing judge said Stone "was prosecuted for covering up for the president". First impeachment Main article: ||First_impeachment_of_Donald_Trump||  Members of House of Representatives vote on two ||Articles_of_impeachment|| (), December 18, 2019 In August 2019, a ||Whistleblower_protection_in_the_United_States|| filed a complaint with the ||Inspector_General_of_the_Intelligence_Community|| about a July 25 phone call between Trump and President of Ukraine ||Volodymyr_Zelenskyy||, during which Trump had pressured Zelenskyy to investigate CrowdStrike and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son ||Hunter_Biden||, adding that the White House had attempted to cover-up the incident. The whistleblower stated that the call was part of a wider campaign by the Trump administration and Giuliani that may have included withholding financial aid from Ukraine in July 2019 and canceling Pence's May 2019 Ukraine trip. Trump later ||Trump-Ukraine_scandal||, offering contradictory reasons for the decision. House Speaker ||Nancy_Pelosi|| initiated ||Impeachment_inquiry_against_Donald_Trump|| in September. The Trump administration subsequently released a memorandum of the July 25 phone call, confirming that after Zelenskyy mentioned purchasing American anti-tank missiles, Trump asked Zelenskyy to investigate and to discuss these matters with Giuliani and Attorney General ||William_Barr||. The testimony of multiple administration officials and former officials confirmed that this was part of a broader effort to further Trump's personal interests by giving him an advantage in the upcoming presidential election. In October, ||William_B._Taylor_Jr.||, the ||List_of_ambassadors_of_the_United_States_to_Ukraine||, testified before congressional committees that soon after arriving in Ukraine in June 2019, he found that Zelenskyy was being subjected to pressure directed by Trump and led by Giuliani. According to Taylor and others, the goal was to coerce Zelenskyy into making a public commitment investigating the company that employed Hunter Biden, as well as rumors about Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He said it was made clear that until Zelenskyy made such an announcement, the administration would not release scheduled military aid for Ukraine and not invite Zelenskyy to the White House. On December 13, the House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to pass two articles of impeachment: one for abuse of power and one for obstruction of Congress. After debate, the House of Representatives impeached Trump on both articles on December 18. Impeachment trial in the Senate Main article: ||First_impeachment_trial_of_Donald_Trump|| The Senate impeachment trial began on January 16, 2020. On January 22, the Republican Senate majority rejected amendments proposed by the Democratic minority to call witnesses and subpoena documents; evidence collected during the House impeachment proceedings was entered into the Senate record. For three days, January 22–24, the House impeachment managers presented their case to the Senate. They cited evidence to support charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and asserted that Trump's actions were exactly what the founding fathers had in mind when they created the Constitution's impeachment process.  Trump displaying the front page of ||The_Washington_Post|| reporting his acquittal by the Senate Responding over the next three days, Trump's lawyers did not deny the facts as presented in the charges but said Trump had not broken any laws or obstructed Congress. They argued that the impeachment was "constitutionally and legally invalid" because Trump was not charged with a crime and that abuse of power is not an impeachable offense. On January 31, the Senate voted against allowing subpoenas for witnesses or documents; 51 Republicans formed the majority for this vote. The impeachment trial was the first in U.S. history without witness testimony. Trump was acquitted of both charges by the Republican Senate majority, 52–48 on abuse of power and 53–47 on obstruction of Congress. Senator ||Mitt_Romney|| was the only Republican who voted to convict Trump on one of the charges, the abuse of power. Following his acquittal, Trump fired impeachment witnesses and other political appointees and career officials he deemed insufficiently loyal. 2020 presidential election Main articles: ||Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign|| and ||2020_United_States_presidential_election|| See also: ||2020_United_States_Postal_Service_crisis|| Breaking with precedent, Trump filed to run for a second term with the FEC within a few hours of assuming the presidency. He held his first re-election rally less than a month after taking office and officially became the ||2020_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries|| in August 2020. In his first two years in office, Trump's reelection committee reported raising $67.5 million and began 2019 with $19.3 million in cash. By July 2020, the Trump campaign and the Republican Party had raised $1.1 billion and spent $800 million, losing their cash advantage over Democratic nominee Joe Biden. The cash shortage forced the campaign to scale back advertising spending.  Trump at a 2020 campaign rally in ||Arizona|| Starting in spring 2020, Trump began to sow doubts about the election, claiming without evidence that the election would be rigged and that the expected widespread use of mail balloting would produce massive election fraud. In July Trump raised the idea of delaying the election. When in August the House of Representatives voted for a $25 billion grant to the U.S. Postal Service for the expected surge in mail voting, Trump blocked funding, saying he wanted to prevent any increase in voting by mail. He repeatedly refused to say whether he would accept the results of the election and commit to a ||Peaceful_transition_of_power|| if he lost. Trump campaign advertisements focused on crime, claiming that cities would descend into lawlessness if Biden won the presidency. Trump repeatedly misrepresented Biden's positions and shifted to appeals to racism. Biden won the election on November 3, receiving 81.3 million votes (51.3 percent) to Trump's 74.2 million (46.8 percent) and 306 ||United_States_Electoral_College|| votes to Trump's 232. Claims of voting fraud, attempt to prevent presidential transition See also: ||Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election||, ||2020%E2%80%9321_United_States_election_protests||, and ||2021_United_States_Capitol_attack||  2020 Electoral College results, Trump lost 232–306 At 2 a.m. the morning after the election, with the results still unclear, Trump declared victory. After Biden was projected the winner days later, Trump said, "this election is far from over" and baselessly alleged election fraud. Trump and his allies filed many ||Post-election_lawsuits_related_to_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election||, which were rejected by at least 86 judges in both the ||State_court_(United_States)|| and ||United_States_federal_courts||, including by federal judges appointed by Trump himself, finding no factual or legal basis. Trump's unsubstantiated allegations of widespread voting fraud were also refuted by state election officials. After ||Cybersecurity_and_Infrastructure_Security_Agency|| (CISA) director ||Chris_Krebs|| contradicted Trump's fraud allegations, Trump dismissed him on November 17. On December 11, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear ||Texas_v._Pennsylvania|| that asked the court to overturn the election results in four states won by Biden. Trump withdrew from public activities in the weeks following the election. He initially blocked government officials from cooperating in ||Presidential_transition_of_Joe_Biden||. After three weeks, the administrator of the ||General_Services_Administration|| declared Biden the "apparent winner" of the election, allowing the disbursement of transition resources to his team. Trump still did not formally concede while claiming he recommended the GSA begin transition protocols. The Electoral College formalized Biden's victory on December 14. From November to January, Trump repeatedly sought help to ||Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election||, personally pressuring various Republican local and state office-holders, Republican state and federal legislators, the Justice Department, and Vice President Pence, urging various actions such as replacing presidential electors, or a request for Georgia officials to "find" votes and announce a "recalculated" result. On February 10, 2021, Georgia prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into Trump's efforts to subvert the election in Georgia. Trump did not attend Biden's inauguration, leaving Washington for Florida hours before. Concern about a possible coup attempt or military action In December 2020, ||Newsweek|| reported ||The_Pentagon|| was on red alert, and ranking officers had discussed what they would do if Trump decided to declare ||Martial_law||. The Pentagon responded with quotes from defense leaders that the military has no role to play in the outcome of the election. When Trump moved supporters into positions of power at the Pentagon after the November 2020 election, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ||Mark_Milley|| and CIA director ||Gina_Haspel|| became concerned about the threat of a possible ||Self-coup|| attempt or military action against China or Iran. Milley insisted that he should be consulted about any military orders from Trump, including the use of nuclear weapons, and he instructed Haspel and NSA director ||Paul_Nakasone|| to monitor developments closely. 2021 Capitol attack Main article: ||2021_United_States_Capitol_attack|| On January 6, 2021, while ||2021_United_States_Electoral_College_vote_count|| was taking place in the United States Capitol, Trump held a rally at ||The_Ellipse||, where he called for the election result to be overturned and urged his supporters to "take back our country" by marching to the Capitol to "show strength" and "fight like hell". Trump's speech started at noon. By 12:30 p.m., rally attendees had gathered outside the Capitol, and at 1 p.m., his supporters pushed past police barriers onto Capitol grounds. Trump's speech ended at 1:10 p.m., and many supporters marched to the Capitol as he had urged, joining the crowd there. Around 2:15 p.m. the mob broke into the building, disrupting certification and causing the evacuation of Congress. During the violence, Trump posted mixed messages on Twitter and Facebook, eventually tweeting to the rioters at 6 p.m., "go home with love & in peace", but describing them as "great patriots" and "very special", while still complaining that the election was stolen. After the mob was removed from the Capitol, Congress reconvened and confirmed the Biden election win in the early hours of the following morning. There were many injuries, and five people, including a Capitol Police officer, died. Second impeachment Main articles: ||Second_impeachment_of_Donald_Trump|| and ||Second_impeachment_trial_of_Donald_Trump||  Speaker of the House ||Nancy_Pelosi|| signing the second impeachment of Trump On January 11, 2021, an article of impeachment charging Trump with ||Incitement_of_insurrection|| against the U.S. government was introduced to the House. The House voted 232–197 to impeach Trump on January 13, making him the first U.S. officeholder to be impeached twice. The impeachment, which was the most rapid in history, followed an unsuccessful bipartisan effort to strip Trump of his powers and duties via Section 4 of the ||25th_Amendment||. Ten Republicans voted for impeachment—the most members of a party ever to vote to impeach a president of their own party. Senate Democrats asked to begin the trial immediately, while Trump was still in office, but then-||Senate_majority_leader|| Mitch McConnell blocked the plan. On February 13, following a ||Second_impeachment_trial_of_Donald_Trump||, Trump was acquitted when the Senate voted 57–43 for conviction, falling ten votes short of the two-thirds majority required to convict; seven Republicans joined every Democrat in voting to convict, the most bipartisan support in any Senate impeachment trial of a president or former president. Most Republicans voted to acquit Trump, though some held him responsible but felt the Senate did not have jurisdiction over former presidents (Trump had left office on January 20; the Senate voted 56–44 the trial was constitutional). Included in the latter group was McConnell, who said Trump was "practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day" but "constitutionally not eligible for conviction". Post-presidency (2021–present)  Trump speaks at the "Rally to Protect Our Elections" in Phoenix, Arizona, July 2021. Since his term ended, Trump has lived at his Mar-a-Lago club. As provided for by the ||Former_Presidents_Act#Staff_and_office||, he established an office there to handle his post-presidential activities. Since leaving the presidency, Trump has been the subject of several probes into both his business dealings and his actions during the presidency. In February 2021, the District Attorney for ||Fulton_County,_Georgia||, announced a criminal probe into Trump's ||Trump%E2%80%93Raffensperger_phone_call|| to ||Brad_Raffensperger||. Separately, the ||Attorney_General_of_New_York|| is conducting civil and criminal investigations into Trump's business activities, the criminal investigation in conjunction with the ||New_York_County_District_Attorney||. By May 2021, a special ||Grand_jury#United_States|| was considering indictments. On July 1, 2021, New York prosecutors charged the Trump Organization with a "15 year 'scheme to defraud' the government". The organization's chief financial officer, ||Allen_Weisselberg||, was arraigned on ||Grand_larceny||, ||Tax_fraud||, and other charges. Trump's false claims concerning the 2020 election were commonly referred to as the "||Big_Lie||" by his critics and in reporting. In May 2021, Trump and his supporters attempted to co-opt the term, using it to refer to the election itself. The Republican Party used Trump's false election narrative to justify the ||Republican_efforts_to_restrict_voting_following_the_2020_presidential_election|| in its favor, and Trump endorsed candidates such as ||Mark_Finchem|| and ||Jody_Hice||, who tried to overturn the 2020 election results and are running for statewide ||Secretary_of_state_(U.S._state_government)|| positions, which would put them in charge of the 2024 elections. On June 6, 2021, Trump resumed his campaign-style rallies with an 85-minute speech at the annual ||North_Carolina_Republican_Party|| convention. On June 26, he held his first public rally since the January 6 rally that preceded the ||2021_United_States_Capitol_attack||. In February 2021, Trump registered a company ||Trump_Media_%26_Technology_Group|| (TMTG), for providing "social networking services" to "customers in the United States". In October 2021, Trump announced the planned merger of TMTG with Digital World Acquisition, a ||Special_purpose_acquisition_company|| (SPAC). A main backer of the SPAC is China-based financier ARC Group, who was reportedly involved in setting up the proposed merger. The transaction is under investigation by the ||U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission||. Public profile Main article: ||Public_image_of_Donald_Trump|| Approval ratings Further information: ||Opinion_polling_on_the_Donald_Trump_administration|| Trump was the only president to never reach a 50% approval rating in the Gallup poll dating to 1938. The approval ratings showed a record partisan gap: 88 percent among Republicans, 7 percent among Democrats. Until September 2020, the ratings were unusually stable, reaching a high of 49 percent and a low of 35 percent. Trump finished his term with a record-low approval rating of between 29 percent and 34 percent (the lowest of any president since modern ||Opinion_poll|| began) and a record-low average of 41 percent throughout his presidency. In ||Gallup%27s_most_admired_man_and_woman_poll|| asking Americans to name the man they admire the most, Trump placed second to Obama in 2017 and 2018, tied with Obama for most admired man in 2019, and was named most admired in 2020. Since ||Gallup_(company)|| started conducting the poll in 1948, Trump is the first elected president not to be named most admired in his first year in office. A Gallup poll in 134 countries comparing the approval ratings of U.S. leadership between the years 2016 and 2017 found that Trump led Obama in job approval in only 29, most of them non-democracies, with approval of US leadership plummeting among US allies and G7 countries. Overall ratings were similar to those in the last two years of the ||Presidency_of_George_W._Bush||. By mid-2020, only 16% of international respondents to a 13-nation ||Pew_Research|| poll expressed confidence in Trump, a lower score than those historically accorded to Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping. ||C-SPAN||, which conducted surveys of presidential leadership each time the administration changed since 2000, ranked Trump fourth–lowest overall in their ||Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States#2021_C-SPAN_Presidential_Historians_Survey||, with Trump rated lowest in the leadership characteristics categories for moral authority and administrative skills. Social media Main article: ||Social_media_use_by_Donald_Trump|| Trump's social media presence attracted attention worldwide since he joined Twitter in 2009. He frequently tweeted during the 2016 election campaign and as president, until his ban in the final days of his term. Over twelve years, Trump posted around 57,000 tweets, often using Twitter as a direct means of communication with the public and sidelining the press. In June 2017, a White House press secretary said that Trump's tweets were official presidential statements. Trump often announced terminations of administration officials and cabinet members over Twitter. After years of criticism for allowing Trump to post misinformation and falsehoods, Twitter began to tag some of his tweets with fact-checking warnings in May 2020. In response, Trump tweeted that "Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives [||Sic||] voices" and that he would "strongly regulate, or close them down". In the days after the storming of the United States Capitol, Trump was banned from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other platforms. Twitter blocked attempts by Trump and his staff to ||Sock_puppet_account#Block_evasion|| through the use of others' accounts. The loss of Trump's social media megaphone, including his 88.7 million Twitter followers, diminished his ability to shape events, and prompted a dramatic decrease in the volume of misinformation shared on Twitter. In May 2021, an advisory group to Facebook evaluated that site's indefinite ban of Trump and concluded that it had been justified at the time but should be re-evaluated in six months. In June 2021, Facebook suspended the account for two years. Later in June, Trump joined the video platform ||Rumble_(website)|| and began to post the messages of his website blog on the Twitter account of a spokesperson. Trump's attempts to re-establish a social media presence were unsuccessful. In May 2021 he launched a blog that had low readership and was closed after less than a month. Relationship with the press Further information: ||Presidency_of_Donald_Trump#Relationship_with_the_news_media||  Trump talking to the press, March 2017 Trump began promoting himself in the press in the 1970s, and continued to seek media attention throughout his career, sustaining a "love–hate" relationship with the press. In the 2016 campaign, Trump benefited from a record amount of free media coverage, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries. New York Times writer ||Amy_Chozick|| wrote in 2018 that Trump's media dominance enthralled the public and created "must-see TV." As a candidate and as president, Trump frequently accused the press of bias, calling it the "fake news media" and "the ||Enemy_of_the_people||". In 2018, journalist ||Lesley_Stahl|| recounted Trump's saying he intentionally demeaned and discredited the media "so when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you". As president, Trump privately and publicly mused about revoking the press credentials of journalists he viewed as critical. His administration moved to revoke the press passes of two White House reporters, which were restored by the courts. In 2019, a member of the foreign press reported many of the same concerns as those of media in the U.S., expressing concern that a normalization process by reporters and media results in an inaccurate characterization of Trump. The Trump White House held about a hundred formal press briefings in 2017, declining by half during 2018 and to two in 2019. Trump also deployed the legal system to intimidate the press. In early 2020, the Trump campaign sued The New York Times, The Washington Post, and CNN for defamation in opinion pieces about Russian election interference. Legal experts said that the lawsuits lacked merit and were not likely to succeed. By March 2021, the lawsuits against The New York Times and CNN had been dismissed. False statements Main article: ||Veracity_of_statements_by_Donald_Trump||  ||Fact-checkers|| from The Washington Post, the Toronto Star, and CNN compiled data on "false or misleading claims" (orange background), and "false claims" (violet foreground), respectively. As a candidate and as president, Trump frequently made false statements in public speeches and remarks to an extent unprecedented in American politics. His falsehoods became a distinctive part of his political identity. Trump's false and misleading statements were documented by ||Fact-checker||, including at The Washington Post, which tallied a total of 30,573 false or misleading statements made by Trump over his four-year term. Trump's falsehoods increased in frequency over time, rising from about 6 false or misleading claims per day in his first year as president to 16 per day in his second year to 22 per day in his third year to 39 per day in his final year. He reached 10,000 false or misleading claims 27 months into his term; 20,000 false or misleading claims 14 months later, and 30,000 false or misleading claims five months later. Some of Trump's falsehoods were inconsequential, such as his claims of a large crowd size during his inauguration. Others had more far-reaching effects, such as Trump's promotion of unproven antimalarial drugs as a treatment for COVID‑19 in a press conference and on Twitter in March 2020. The claims had consequences worldwide, such as a shortage of these drugs in the United States and ||Panic-buying|| in Africa and South Asia. Other misinformation, such as misattributing a rise in crime in ||England_and_Wales|| to the "spread of radical Islamic terror", served Trump's domestic political purposes. As a matter of principle, Trump does not apologize for his falsehoods. Despite the frequency of Trump's falsehoods, the media rarely referred to them as lies. The first time The Washington Post did so was in August 2018, when it declared that some of Trump's misstatements, in particular those concerning hush money paid to Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, were lies. In 2020, Trump was a significant source of disinformation on voting and the COVID-19 pandemic. His attacks on mail-in ballots and other election practices served to weaken public faith in the integrity of the 2020 presidential election, while his disinformation about the pandemic delayed and weakened the national response to it. Some view the nature and frequency of Trump's falsehoods as having profound and corrosive consequences on democracy. James Pfiffner, professor of policy and government at George Mason University, wrote in 2019 that Trump lies differently from previous presidents, because he offers "egregious false statements that are demonstrably contrary to well-known facts"; these lies are the "most important" of all Trump lies. By calling facts into question, people will be unable to properly evaluate their government, with beliefs or policy irrationally settled by "political power"; this erodes ||Liberal_democracy||, wrote Pfiffner. Promotion of conspiracy theories Main article: ||List_of_conspiracy_theories_promoted_by_Donald_Trump|| Before and throughout his presidency, Trump has promoted numerous conspiracy theories, including ||Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories||, the ||Clinton_Body_Count|| theory, ||QAnon||, the ||Global_warming_conspiracy_theory|| theory, ||Trump_Tower_wiretapping_allegations||, a ||John_F._Kennedy_assassination_conspiracy_theories|| involving ||Rafael_Cruz||, linking talk show host ||Joe_Scarborough|| to the death of a staffer, alleged foul-play in the death of ||Antonin_Scalia||, ||Conspiracy_theories_related_to_the_Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal||, and that ||Osama_bin_Laden|| was alive and Obama and Biden had members of ||Navy_SEAL_Team_6|| killed. In at least two instances Trump clarified to press that he also believed the conspiracy theory in question. During and since the 2020 presidential election, Trump has promoted various conspiracy theories for his defeat including dead people voting, voting machines changing or deleting Trump votes, fraudulent mail-in voting, throwing out Trump votes, and "finding" suitcases full of Biden votes. Racial views Main article: ||Racial_views_of_Donald_Trump|| Many of Trump's comments and actions have been considered racist. He repeatedly denied this, saying: "I am the least racist person there is anywhere in the world." In national polling, about half of respondents said that Trump is racist; a greater proportion believed that he has emboldened racists. Several studies and surveys found that racist attitudes fueled Trump's political ascent and were more important than economic factors in determining the allegiance of Trump voters. Racist and ||Islamophobic|| attitudes are a strong indicator of support for Trump. In 1975, he settled a 1973 Department of Justice lawsuit that alleged housing discrimination against black renters. He has also been accused of racism for insisting a group of black and Latino teenagers were guilty of raping a white woman in the 1989 ||Central_Park_jogger_case||, even after they were exonerated by DNA evidence in 2002. As of 2019, he maintained this position. Trump relaunched his political career in 2011 as a leading proponent of ||Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories|| alleging that Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, was not born in the United States. In April 2011, Trump claimed credit for pressuring the White House to publish the "long-form" birth certificate, which he considered fraudulent, and later saying this made him "very popular". In September 2016, amid pressure, he acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S. and falsely claimed the rumors had been started by Hillary Clinton during ||Hillary_Clinton_2008_presidential_campaign||. In 2017, he reportedly still expressed birther views in private. According to an analysis in ||Political_Science_Quarterly||, Trump made "explicitly racist appeals to whites" during his 2016 presidential campaign. In particular, his campaign launch speech drew widespread criticism for claiming Mexican immigrants were "bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists". His later comments about a Mexican-American judge presiding over a civil suit regarding ||Trump_University|| were also criticized as racist.  Trump answers questions from reporters about the ||Unite_the_Right_rally|| in Charlottesville. Trump's comments on the ||Unite_the_Right_rally||, condemning "this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides" and stating that there were "very fine people on both sides", were widely criticized as implying a ||Moral_equivalence|| between the white supremacist demonstrators and the counter-protesters. In a January 2018 ||Oval_Office|| meeting to discuss immigration legislation, Trump reportedly referred to El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, and African nations as "shithole countries". His remarks were condemned as racist. In July 2019, Trump tweeted that four Democratic congresswomen—all minorities, three of whom are native-born Americans—should "||Go_back_where_you_came_from||" to the countries they "came from". Two days later the House of Representatives voted 240–187, mostly along party lines, to condemn his "racist comments". ||White_nationalist|| publications and social media sites praised his remarks, which continued over the following days. Trump continued to make similar remarks during his 2020 campaign. Misogyny and allegations of sexual misconduct Main article: ||Donald_Trump_sexual_misconduct_allegations|| Trump has a history of insulting and belittling women when speaking to media and on social media. He made lewd comments, demeaned women's looks, and called them names, such as 'dog', 'crazed, 'crying lowlife', 'face of a pig', or 'horseface'. In October 2016, two days before the ||2016_United_States_presidential_debates#Second_presidential_debate_(Washington_University_in_St._Louis)||, a 2005 "||Hot_mic||" recording surfaced in which ||Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape|| about kissing and groping women without their consent, saying "when you're a star, they let you do it, you can do anything... grab 'em by the ||Pussy#Female_genitalia||." The incident's widespread media exposure led to Trump's first public apology during the campaign and caused outrage across the political spectrum. At least twenty-six women, including his first wife, have publicly accused Trump of sexual misconduct. There were allegations of rape, violence, being kissed and groped without consent, looking under women's skirts, and walking in on naked pageant contestants. In 2016, he denied all accusations, calling them "false smears" and alleging a conspiracy against him and the American people. Incitement of violence Research suggests Trump's rhetoric caused an increased incidence of hate crimes. During his 2016 campaign, he urged or praised physical attacks against protesters or reporters. Numerous defendants investigated or prosecuted for violent acts and hate crimes, including participants of the January 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol, cited Trump's rhetoric in arguing that they were not culpable or should receive a lighter sentence. A nationwide review by ABC News in May 2020 identified at least 54 criminal cases from August 2015 to April 2020 in which Trump was invoked in direct connection with violence or threats of violence mostly by white men and primarily against members of minority groups. Popular culture Main articles: ||Donald_Trump_in_popular_culture|| and ||Donald_Trump_in_music|| Trump has been the subject of parody, comedy, and caricature on television, in movies, and in comics. Trump was named in hundreds of ||Hip_hop_music|| songs since the 1980s, mostly positive. Mentions turned largely negative and pejorative after he began running for office in 2015. Notes  Presidential elections in the United States are decided by the ||United_States_Electoral_College||. Each state names a number of electors equal to its representation in ||United_States_Congress|| and (in most states) all delegates vote for the winner of the local state vote.
