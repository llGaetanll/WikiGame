It is the ||List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area|| by area, the ||List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population|| country, and the most populous ||Democracy|| in the world. Bounded by the ||Indian_Ocean|| on the south, the ||Arabian_Sea|| on the southwest, and the ||Bay_of_Bengal|| on the southeast, it shares land borders with ||Pakistan|| to the west; ||China||, ||Nepal||, and ||Bhutan|| to the north; and ||Bangladesh|| and ||Myanmar|| to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of ||Sri_Lanka|| and the ||Maldives||; its ||Andaman_and_Nicobar_Islands|| share a maritime border with ||Thailand||, ||Myanmar|| and ||Indonesia||. ||Modern_humans|| arrived on the ||Indian_subcontinent|| from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago. Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human ||Genetic_diversity||. ||Neolithic|| emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the ||Indus_River|| ||River_basin|| 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the ||Indus_Valley_Civilisation|| of the third millennium BCE. By 1200 BCE, an ||Proto-language|| of ||Sanskrit||, an ||Indo-European_language||, had ||Trans-cultural_diffusion|| into India from the northwest, ||Oral_transmission|| as the language of the ||Rigveda||, and recording the dawning of ||Hinduism|| in India. The ||Dravidian_languages|| of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions. By 400 BCE, ||Social_stratification|| and ||Social_exclusion|| by ||Caste|| had emerged within Hinduism, and ||History_of_Buddhism_in_India|| and ||History_of_Jainism|| had arisen, proclaiming ||Social_order|| unlinked to heredity. Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit ||Maurya_Empire|| and ||Gupta_Empire|| based in the ||Ganges_Basin||. Their collective ||Era|| was suffused with wide-ranging creativity, but also marked by the declining status of women, and the incorporation of ||Untouchability|| into an organised system of belief. In ||South_India||, the ||Middle_kingdoms_of_India#The_Deccan_plateau_and_South|| exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of ||Southeast_Asia||. In the early medieval era, ||Christianity||, ||Islam||, ||Judaism||, and ||Zoroastrianism|| put down roots on India's southern and western coasts. Muslim armies from ||Central_Asia|| intermittently overran India's northern plains, eventually establishing the ||Delhi_Sultanate||, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan ||Islamic_Golden_Age||. In the 15th century, the ||Vijayanagara_Empire|| created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India. In the ||Punjab||, ||Sikhism|| emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion. The ||Mughal_Empire||, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace, leaving a legacy of luminous architecture. Gradually expanding ||Company_rule_in_India|| followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its ||Sovereignty||. ||British_Raj|| began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly, but ||Industrial_Revolution|| were introduced, and ideas of education, modernity and the public life took root. A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule. In 1947 the British Indian Empire was ||Partition_of_India|| into two independent ||Dominion#India,_Pakistan_and_Bangladesh||, a Hindu-majority ||Dominion_of_India|| and a Muslim-majority ||Dominion_of_Pakistan||, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration. India has been a ||Federal_republic|| since 1950, governed in a democratic ||Parliamentary_system||. It is a ||Pluralism_(political_philosophy)||, ||Multilingualism|| and ||Multiculturalism||. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to 1.211 billion in 2011. During the same time, its nominal ||Per_capita_income|| increased from US$64 annually to US$1,498, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951, India has become a ||List_of_countries_by_real_GDP_growth_rate|| ||G20|| and a hub for ||Information_technology_in_India||, with an expanding middle class. It has ||Indian_Space_Research_Organisation|| which includes several planned or completed ||List_of_Solar_System_probes||. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture. India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality. India is a ||List_of_states_with_nuclear_weapons||, which ranks high in ||List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures||. It has disputes over ||Kashmir|| with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century. Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are ||Gender_inequality_in_India||, ||Malnutrition_in_India||, and rising levels of ||Air_pollution_in_India||. India's land is ||Megadiverse_country||, with four ||Biodiversity_hotspots||. Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area. ||Wildlife_in_India||, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in ||Culture_of_India||, is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in ||Protected_areas_of_India||. Contents Etymology Main article: ||Names_of_India|| According to the ||Oxford_English_Dictionary|| (third edition 2009), the name "India" is derived from the ||Classical_Latin|| India, a reference to ||South_Asia|| and an uncertain region to its east; and in turn derived successively from: ||Hellenistic_Greek|| India ( Ἰνδία); ||Ancient_Greek|| Indos ( Ἰνδός); ||Old_Persian|| ||Hindush||, an eastern province of the ||Achaemenid_empire||; and ultimately its ||Cognate||, the ||Sanskrit|| Sindhu, or "river," specifically the ||Indus_River|| and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin. The ||Ancient_Greece|| referred to the Indians as Indoi (), which translates as "The people of the Indus". The term ||Names_for_India#Bhārata|| (Bhārat; pronounced  ()), mentioned in both ||Indian_epic_poetry|| and the ||Constitution_of_India||, is used in its variations by ||Names_of_India_in_its_official_languages||. A modern rendering of the historical name Bharatavarsha, which applied originally to ||North_India||, Bharat gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India. ||Hindustan|| ( ()) is a ||Middle_Persian|| name for India, introduced during the ||Mughal_Empire|| and used widely since. Its meaning has varied, referring to a region encompassing present-day northern India and ||Pakistan|| or to India in its near entirety. History Main articles: ||History_of_India|| and ||History_of_the_Republic_of_India|| Ancient India  An illustration from an early-modern manuscript of the Sanskrit epic ||Ramayana||, composed in story-telling fashion c. 400 BCE – c. 300 CE. By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or ||Homo_sapiens||, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved. The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago. After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in ||Mehrgarh|| and other sites in what is now ||Balochistan,_Pakistan||. These gradually developed into the ||Indus_Valley_Civilisation||, the first urban culture in South Asia, which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in what is now Pakistan and western India. Centred around cities such as ||Mohenjo-daro||, ||Harappa||, ||Dholavira||, and ||Kalibangan||, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade. During the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the ||Chalcolithic|| cultures to the ||Iron_Age|| ones. The ||Vedas||, the oldest scriptures associated with ||Hinduism||, were composed during this period, and historians have analysed these to posit a ||Vedic_period|| in the ||Punjab_region|| and the upper ||Indo-Gangetic_Plain||. Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of ||Indo-Aryan_migration|| into the subcontinent from the north-west. The ||Caste_system||, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period. On the ||Deccan_Plateau||, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation. In ||South_India||, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of ||Megalith|| monuments dating from this period, as well as by nearby traces of ||Agriculture||, ||Irrigation_tanks||, and craft traditions.  Cave 26 of the rock-cut ||Ajanta_Caves|| In the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the ||Mahajanapadas||. The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. ||Jainism|| came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, ||Mahavira||. ||Buddhism||, based on the teachings of ||Gautama_Buddha||, attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India. In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up ||Nekkhamma|| as an ideal, and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of ||Magadha|| had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the ||Maurya_Empire||. The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas. The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for ||Ashoka||'s renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist ||Dharma_(Buddhism)||. The ||Sangam_literature|| of the ||Tamil_language|| reveals that, between 200 BCE and 200 CE, the southern peninsula was ruled by the ||Chera_Dynasty||, the ||Chola_dynasty||, and the ||Pandyan_Dynasty||, dynasties that ||Indo-Roman_trade|| and with ||Western_Asia|| and ||Southeast_Asia||. In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women. By the 4th and 5th centuries, the ||Gupta_Empire|| had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms. Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself. This renewal was reflected in a flowering of ||Sculpture_in_the_Indian_subcontinent|| and ||Architecture_of_India||, which found patrons among an urban elite. ||Sanskrit_literature#Classical_Sanskrit_literature|| flowered as well, and ||History_of_science_and_technology_in_the_Indian_subcontinent||, ||Indian_astronomy||, ||Ayurveda||, and ||Indian_mathematics|| made significant advances. Medieval India ||Brihadeshwara_temple||, ||Thanjavur||, completed in 1010 CEThe ||Qutub_Minar||, 73 m (240 ft) tall, completed by the ||Sultan_of_Delhi||, ||Iltutmish|| The Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity. When ||Harsha|| of ||Kannauj||, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the ||Chalukya_dynasty|| ruler of the Deccan. When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the ||Pala_Empire|| king of ||Bengal||. When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the ||Pallava_dynasty|| from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the ||Pandya_dynasty|| and the ||Chola_dynasty|| from still farther south. No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region. During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes. The caste system consequently began to show regional differences. In the 6th and 7th centuries, the first ||Bhakti|| were created in the Tamil language. They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all ||Languages_of_India||. Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well. Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation. By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day ||Myanmar||, ||Thailand||, ||Laos||, ||Cambodia||, ||Vietnam||, ||Philippines||, ||Malaysia||, and ||Java||. Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages. After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using ||Courser_(horse)|| cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic ||Delhi_Sultanate|| in 1206. The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs. By repeatedly repulsing ||Mongol_Empire|| in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of ||Human_migration|| of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north. The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous ||Vijayanagara_Empire||. Embracing a strong ||Shaivism|| tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India, and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards. Early modern India In the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers, fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors. The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices and diverse and inclusive ruling elites, leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule. Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under ||Akbar||, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status. The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency, caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets. The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion, resulting in greater patronage of ||Mughal_painting||, literary forms, textiles, and ||Mughal_architecture||. Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the ||Maratha_Empire||, the ||Rajputs||, and the ||Sikh_empire||, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience. Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India. As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs. A distant view of the ||Taj_Mahal|| from the ||Agra_Fort||A two ||Mohur|| Company gold coin, issued in 1835, the ||Obverse_and_reverse|| inscribed "||William_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom||" By the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English ||East_India_Company||, had established coastal outposts. The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies. Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annexe or subdue most of India by the 1820s. India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the ||British_Empire|| with raw materials. Many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period. By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration, the company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas like education, social reform, and culture. Modern India Main article: ||History_of_the_Republic_of_India|| Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of ||James_Broun-Ramsay,_1st_Marquess_of_Dalhousie|| as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in ||Europe||. However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the ||Indian_Rebellion_of_1857||. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule. Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the ||British_Raj|| by the British government. Proclaiming a ||Unitary_state|| and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest. In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the ||Indian_National_Congress|| in 1885. The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets. There was an increase in the number of large-scale ||Famine_in_India||, and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians. There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption. The railway network provided critical famine relief, notably reduced the cost of moving goods, and helped nascent Indian-owned industry. 1909 map of the British Indian Empire||Jawaharlal_Nehru|| sharing a light moment with ||Mohandas_Karamchand_Gandhi||, Mumbai, 6 July 1946 After World War I, in which approximately ||Indian_Army_during_World_War_I||, a new period began. It was marked by ||Montagu%E2%80%93Chelmsford_Reforms|| but also ||Rowlatt_act||, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings of a ||Nonviolent|| movement of non-co-operation, of which ||Mohandas_Karamchand_Gandhi|| would become the leader and enduring symbol. During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections. The next decade was beset with crises: ||India_in_World_War_II||, the Congress's final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by the ||Partition_of_India|| into two states: India and Pakistan. Vital to India's self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in place a secular and democratic republic. It has remained a democracy with civil liberties, an active supreme court, and a largely independent press. Economic liberalisation, which began in the 1990s, has created a large urban middle class, transformed India into ||List_of_countries_by_GDP_(real)_growth_rate||, and increased its geopolitical clout. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture. Yet, India is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty, both rural and urban; by ||Religious_violence_in_India|| and ||Caste-related_violence_in_India||; by ||Naxalite||; and by ||Insurgency_in_Jammu_and_Kashmir|| and ||Insurgency_in_Northeast_India||. It has unresolved territorial disputes with ||China%E2%80%93India_relations#1960s|| and with ||Indo-Pakistani_wars_and_conflicts||. India's sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world's newer nations; however, in spite of its recent economic successes, freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved. Geography Main article: ||Geography_of_India|| India accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the ||Indian_Plate||, a part of the ||Indo-Australian_Plate||. India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent ||Gondwana||, began a north-eastward ||Plate_tectonics|| caused by ||Seafloor_spreading|| to its south-west, and later, south and south-east. Simultaneously, the vast ||Tethys_Ocean|| ||Oceanic_crust||, to its northeast, began to ||Subduction|| under the ||Eurasian_Plate||. These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's ||Mantle_(geology)||, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian ||Continental_crust|| eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the ||Himalayas||. Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast ||Trough_(geology)|| that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment and now constitutes the ||Indo-Gangetic_Plain||. Cut off from the plain by the ancient ||Aravalli_Range|| lies the ||Thar_Desert||. The ||Tungabhadra_river||, with rocky outcrops, flows into the peninsular ||Krishna_river||.Fishing boats lashed together before a monsoon storm in a ||Creek_(tidal)|| in ||Anjarle|| village, Maharashtra. The original Indian Plate survives as ||South_India||, the oldest and geologically most stable part of India. It extends as far north as the ||Satpura_Range|| and ||Vindhya_Range|| ranges in central India. These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal-rich ||Chota_Nagpur_Plateau|| in Jharkhand in the east. To the south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the ||Deccan_Plateau||, is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the ||Western_Ghats|| and ||Eastern_Ghats||; the plateau contains the country's oldest rock formations, some over one billion years old. Constituted in such fashion, India lies to the north of the equator between 6° 44′ and 35° 30′ north latitude and 68° 7′ and 97° 25′ east longitude. India's coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700 mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400 mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300 mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains. According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% ||Mudflat|| or marshy shores. Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the ||Ganges|| and the ||Brahmaputra_River||, both of which drain into the ||Bay_of_Bengal||. Important tributaries of the Ganges include the ||Yamuna|| and the ||Kosi_River||; the latter's extremely low gradient, caused by long-term silt deposition, leads to severe floods and course changes. Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the ||Godavari_River||, the ||Mahanadi_River||, the ||Kaveri_River||, and the ||Krishna_River||, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal; and the ||Narmada_River|| and the ||Tapti_River||, which drain into the ||Arabian_Sea||. Coastal features include the marshy ||Rann_of_Kutch|| of western India and the alluvial ||Sundarbans|| delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh. India has two ||Archipelago||: the ||Lakshadweep||, ||Atoll|| off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the ||Andaman_Sea||. ||Climate_of_India|| is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter ||Monsoon||. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian ||Katabatic_wind|| from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: ||Climate_of_India#Tropical_wet||, ||Climate_of_India#Tropical_dry||, ||Climate_of_India#Subtropical_humid||, and ||Climate_of_India#Mountain||. Temperatures in India have risen by 0.7 °C (1.3 °F) between 1901 and 2018. ||Climate_change_in_India|| is often thought to be the cause. The ||Retreat_of_glaciers_since_1850|| has adversely affected the ||Volumetric_flow_rate|| of the major Himalayan rivers, including the ||Ganges|| and the ||Brahmaputra||. According to some current projections, the number and severity of droughts in India will have markedly increased by the end of the present century. Biodiversity Main articles: ||Forestry_in_India|| and ||Wildlife_of_India||  A 2010 map showing India's forest cover averaged out for each state.

India is a ||Megadiverse_country||, a term employed for 17 countries which display high ||Biological_diversity|| and contain many species exclusively ||Indigenous_(ecology)||, or ||Endemic||, to them. India is a ||Habitat|| for 8.6% of all ||Mammal|| species, 13.7% of ||Bird|| species, 7.9% of ||Reptile|| species, 6% of ||Amphibian|| species, 12.2% of ||Fish|| species, and 6.0% of all ||Flowering_plant|| species. Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic. India also contains four of the world's 34 ||Biodiversity_hotspot||, or regions that display significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemism. According to official statistics, India's ||Forest_cover|| is 713,789 km (275,595 sq mi), which is 21.71% of the country's total land area. It can be subdivided further into broad categories of canopy density, or the proportion of the area of a forest covered by its ||Tree_canopy||. Very dense forest, whose canopy density is greater than 70%, occupies 3.02% of India's land area. It predominates in the ||Tropical_and_subtropical_moist_broadleaf_forest|| of the ||Andaman_Islands||, the ||Western_Ghats||, and ||Northeast_India||. Moderately dense forest, whose canopy density is between 40% and 70%, occupies 9.39% of India's land area. It predominates in the ||Temperate_coniferous_forest|| of the ||Himalaya||, the moist deciduous ||Shorea_robusta|| forest of eastern India, and the dry deciduous ||Teak|| forest of central and southern India. Open forest, whose canopy density is between 10% and 40%, occupies 9.26% of India's land area, and predominates in the ||Acacia_nilotica||-dominated ||Deserts_and_xeric_shrublands|| of the central ||Deccan_Plateau|| and the western ||Gangetic_plain||. Among the Indian subcontinent's notable indigenous trees are the ||Astringent|| ||Azadirachta_indica||, or neem, which is widely used in rural Indian ||Herbal_medicine||, and the luxuriant ||Ficus_religiosa||, or peepul, which is displayed on the ancient seals of ||Mohenjo-daro||, and under which ||Gautama_Buddha|| is recorded in the ||P%C4%81li_Canon|| to have sought enlightenment. Many Indian species have descended from those of Gondwana, the southern ||Supercontinent|| from which India separated more than 100 million years ago. India's subsequent collision with Eurasia set off a mass exchange of species. However, ||Deccan_Traps|| and ||Climate_variability_and_change|| later caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms. Still later, mammals entered India from Asia through two ||Zoogeographical|| passes flanking the Himalayas. This had the effect of lowering endemism among India's mammals, which stands at 12.6%, contrasting with 45.8% among reptiles and 55.8% among amphibians.} Notable endemics are the vulnerable ||Nilgiri_Langur|| and the threatened ||Duttaphrynus_beddomii|| of the Western Ghats. India contains 172 ||World_Conservation_Union||-designated ||List_of_endangered_animals_in_India||, or 2.9% of endangered forms. These include the endangered ||Bengal_tiger|| and the ||South_Asian_river_dolphin||. ||Critically_endangered|| species include: the ||Gharial||, a ||Crocodilian||; the ||Great_Indian_bustard||; and the ||Indian_white-rumped_vulture||, which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of ||Diclofenac||-treated cattle. The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife. In response, the system of ||National_parks_of_India|| and ||Protected_areas_of_India||, first established in 1935, was expanded substantially. In 1972, India enacted the ||Wildlife_Protection_Act_of_1972|| and ||Project_Tiger|| to safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988. India hosts ||Wildlife_sanctuaries_of_India|| and ||Biosphere_reserves_of_India||, four of which are part of the ||World_Network_of_Biosphere_Reserves||; ||List_of_Ramsar_Sites_in_India|| are registered under the ||Ramsar_Convention||. Politics and government Politics Main article: ||Politics_of_India|| ||Social_movement|| have long been a part of ||Democracy_in_India||. The picture shows a section of 25,000 ||Landless|| people in the state of ||Madhya_Pradesh|| listening to ||Rajagopal_P._V.|| before their 350 km (220 mi) march, ||Janadesh_2007||, from ||Gwalior|| to ||New_Delhi|| to publicise their demand for further ||Land_reform_in_India||. India is the world's most populous ||Democracy||. A ||Parliamentary_republic|| with a ||Multi-party_system||, it has eight recognised ||List_of_recognised_political_parties_in_India#National||, including the ||Indian_National_Congress|| and the ||Bharatiya_Janata_Party|| (BJP), and more than 40 ||List_of_recognised_political_parties_in_India#State||. The Congress is considered centre-left in Indian ||Political_culture||, and the BJP ||Right-wing_politics||. For most of the period between 1950—when India first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP, as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party ||Coalition_government|| at the centre. In the Republic of India's first three general elections, in 1951, 1957, and 1962, the ||Jawaharlal_Nehru||-led Congress won easy victories. On Nehru's death in 1964, ||Lal_Bahadur_Shastri|| briefly became prime minister; he was succeeded, after his own unexpected death in 1966, by Nehru's daughter ||Indira_Gandhi||, who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971. Following public discontent with the ||The_Emergency_(India)|| she declared in 1975, the Congress was voted out of power in 1977; the then-new ||Janata_Party||, which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted just over two years. Voted back into power in 1980, the Congress saw a change in leadership in 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated; she was succeeded by her son ||Rajiv_Gandhi||, who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year. The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a ||National_Front_(India)|| coalition, led by the newly formed ||Janata_Dal|| in alliance with the ||Communist_Party_of_India_(Marxist)||, won the elections; that government too proved relatively short-lived, lasting just under two years. Elections were held again in 1991; no party won an absolute majority. The Congress, as the largest single party, was able to form a ||Minority_government|| led by ||P._V._Narasimha_Rao||. At the ||Parliament_of_India|| in New Delhi, US president ||Barack_Obama|| is shown here addressing the ||Member_of_Parliament_(India)|| of both houses, the lower, ||Lok_Sabha||, and the upper, ||Rajya_Sabha||, in a joint session, 8 November 2010. A two-year period of political turmoil followed the general election of 1996. Several short-lived alliances shared power at the centre. The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996; it was followed by two comparatively long-lasting ||United_Front_(India)|| coalitions, which depended on external support. In 1998, the BJP was able to form a successful coalition, the ||National_Democratic_Alliance|| (NDA). Led by ||Atal_Bihari_Vajpayee||, the NDA became the first non-Congress, ||Coalition_government|| to complete a five-year term. Again in the ||2004_Indian_general_election||, no party won an absolute majority, but the Congress emerged as the largest single party, forming another successful coalition: the ||United_Progressive_Alliance|| (UPA). It had the support of left-leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP. The UPA returned to power in the ||2009_Indian_general_election|| with increased numbers, and it no longer required external support from ||Socialism_in_India||. That year, ||Manmohan_Singh|| became the first prime minister since ||Jawaharlal_Nehru|| in ||1957_Indian_general_election|| and ||1962_Indian_general_election|| to be re-elected to a consecutive five-year term. In the ||2014_Indian_general_election||, the BJP became the first political party since 1984 to win a majority and govern without the support of other parties. The incumbent prime minister is ||Narendra_Modi||, a former ||Chief_minister_(India)|| of ||Gujarat||. On 20 July 2017, ||Ram_Nath_Kovind|| was elected India's 14th president and took the oath of office on 25 July 2017. Government Main articles: ||Government_of_India|| and ||Constitution_of_India|| ||Rashtrapati_Bhavan||, the official residence of the ||President_of_India||, was designed by British architects ||Edwin_Lutyens|| and ||Herbert_Baker|| for the ||Viceroy_of_India||, and constructed between 1911 and 1931 during the ||British_Raj||. India is a ||Federation|| with a ||Parliamentary_system|| governed under the ||Constitution_of_India||—the country's supreme legal document. It is a constitutional republic and ||Representative_democracy||, in which "||Majority_rule|| is tempered by ||Minority_rights|| protected by ||Law_of_India||". ||Federalism_in_India|| defines the power distribution between the union and the ||States_and_territories_of_India||. The Constitution of India, which came into effect on 26 January 1950, originally stated India to be a "||Sovereignty||, ||Liberal_democracy|| ||Republic||;" this characterisation was amended in 1971 to "a sovereign, socialist, ||Secularism||, democratic republic". India's form of government, traditionally described as "quasi-federal" with a strong centre and weak states, has grown increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and social changes. ||National_symbols_of_India||Flag||Flag_of_India|| (Tricolour)Emblem||State_Emblem_of_India||Anthem||Jana_Gana_Mana||Song"||Vande_Mataram||"LanguageNoneCurrency||Indian_rupee_sign|| (||Indian_rupee||)Calendar||Indian_national_calendar||Animal ||Bengal_tiger|| ||South_Asian_river_dolphin|| ||Indian_peafowl|| Flower||Nelumbo_nucifera||Fruit||Mango||Tree||Banyan||River||Ganges|| The ||Government_of_India|| comprises three branches: ||Executive_(government)||: The ||President_of_India|| is the ceremonial ||Head_of_state||, who is elected indirectly for a five-year term by an ||Electoral_College_(India)|| comprising members of national and state legislatures. The ||Prime_Minister_of_India|| is the ||Head_of_government|| and exercises most ||Executive_(government)||. Appointed by the president, the prime minister is by convention supported by the ||Political_party|| or ||Political_alliance|| having a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament. The executive of the Indian government consists of the president, the ||Vice_President_of_India||, and the ||Union_Council_of_Ministers||—with the ||Cabinet_(government)|| being its executive committee—headed by the prime minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of one of the houses of parliament. In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature; the prime minister and their council are directly responsible to the lower house of the parliament. ||Civil_Services_of_India|| act as permanent executives and all decisions of the ||Executive_(government)|| are implemented by them. ||Legislature||: The legislature of India is the ||Bicameralism|| ||Parliament_of_India||. Operating under a ||Westminster_system|| parliamentary system, it comprises an upper house called the ||Rajya_Sabha|| (Council of States) and a lower house called the ||Lok_Sabha|| (House of the People). The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body of 245 members who serve staggered six-year terms. Most are elected indirectly by the ||States_and_union_territories_of_India|| legislatures in numbers proportional to their state's share of the national population. All but two of the Lok Sabha's 545 members are elected directly by popular vote; they represent ||Single-member_constituency|| for five-year terms. Two seats of parliament, reserved for ||Anglo-Indian|| in the article 331, have been scrapped. ||Judiciary||: India has a three-tier unitary ||Judicial_independence|| comprising the ||Supreme_Court_of_India||, headed by the ||Chief_Justice_of_India||, 25 ||High_courts_of_India||, and a large number of trial courts. The supreme court has ||Original_jurisdiction|| over cases involving ||Fundamental_rights_in_India|| and over disputes between states and the centre and has ||Appellate_jurisdiction|| over the high courts. It has the power to both strike down union or state laws which contravene the constitution, and invalidate any government action it deems unconstitutional. Administrative divisions Main article: ||Administrative_divisions_of_India|| See also: ||Political_integration_of_India|| India is a federal union comprising 28 ||States_and_union_territories_of_India|| and 8 ||Union_territory|| (listed below as 1–28 and A–H, respectively). All states, as well as the union territories of ||Jammu_and_Kashmir_(union_territory)||, ||Puducherry_(union_territory)|| and the ||Delhi||, have elected legislatures and governments following the Westminster system of governance. The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the central government through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the ||States_Reorganisation_Act,_1956||, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis. There are over a quarter of a million local government bodies at city, town, block, district and village levels.

From left to right: ||Gamal_Abdel_Nasser|| of ||United_Arab_Republic|| (now Egypt), ||Josip_Broz_Tito|| of ||Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia|| and ||Jawaharlal_Nehru|| in Belgrade, September 1961. In the 1950s, India strongly supported decolonisation in ||Africa|| and ||Asia|| and ||India_and_the_Non-Aligned_Movement|| in the ||Non-Aligned_Movement||. After initially cordial relations with neighbouring China, India went to ||Sino-Indian_War||, and was widely thought to have been humiliated. India has had ||Indo-Pakistani_relations|| with neighbouring Pakistan; the two nations have gone to war four times: in ||Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1947||, ||Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1965||, ||Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1971||, and ||Kargil_War||. Three of these wars were fought over the ||Kashmir_conflict||, while the fourth, the 1971 war, followed from India's support for the ||Bangladesh_Liberation_War||. In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice intervened abroad at the invitation of the host country: a ||Indian_Peace_Keeping_Force|| in ||Sri_Lanka|| between 1987 and 1990; and an armed intervention to prevent a ||1988_Maldives_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat|| in the Maldives. After the 1965 war with Pakistan, India began to pursue close military and economic ||India-Soviet_Union_relations||; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier. Aside from ongoing its ||India%E2%80%93Russia_relations||, India has wide-ranging ||India%E2%80%93Israel_relations|| and ||France%E2%80%93India_relations||. In recent years, it has played key roles in the ||South_Asian_Association_for_Regional_Cooperation|| and the ||World_Trade_Organization||. The nation has provided 100,000 ||Indian_Armed_Forces|| and ||Law_enforcement_in_India|| personnel to serve in 35 ||United_Nations_peacekeeping|| across four continents. It participates in the ||East_Asia_Summit||, the ||G8%2B5||, and other multilateral forums. India has close economic ties with countries in ||South_America||, Asia, and Africa; it pursues a ||Look_East_policy_(India)|| that seeks to strengthen partnerships with the ||Association_of_Southeast_Asian_Nations|| nations, ||India%E2%80%93Japan_relations||, and ||India%E2%80%93South_Korea_relations|| that revolve around many issues, but especially those involving economic investment and regional security.

The parade at which India was the foreign guest was led by the India's oldest regiment, the ||Maratha_Light_Infantry||, founded in 1768. China's ||596_(nuclear_test)||, as well as its repeated threats to intervene in support of Pakistan in the 1965 war, convinced India to develop nuclear weapons. India conducted its ||Smiling_Buddha|| in 1974 and carried out ||Pokhran-II|| in 1998. Despite criticism and military sanctions, India has signed neither the ||Comprehensive_Nuclear-Test-Ban_Treaty|| nor the ||Nuclear_Non-Proliferation_Treaty||, considering both to be flawed and discriminatory. India maintains a "||No_first_use||" nuclear policy and is developing a ||Nuclear_triad|| capability as a part of its "||Minimum_Credible_Deterrence||" doctrine. It is developing a ||Indian_Ballistic_Missile_Defense_Program|| and, a ||HAL_AMCA||. Other indigenous military projects involve the design and implementation of ||Vikrant_class_aircraft_carrier|| and ||Arihant_class_submarine||. Since the end of the ||Cold_War||, India has increased its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the ||India%E2%80%93United_States_relations|| and the ||India%E2%80%93European_Union_relations||. In 2008, a ||U.S.%E2%80%93India_Civil_Nuclear_Agreement|| was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the ||International_Atomic_Energy_Agency|| and the ||Nuclear_Suppliers_Group||, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state. India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving ||Nuclear_power_in_India|| with Russia, France, the ||India%E2%80%93United_Kingdom_relations||, and ||Canada%E2%80%93India_relations||.

The official Indian ||List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures|| for 2011 was US$36.03 billion, or 1.83% of GDP. Defence expenditure was pegged at US$70.12 billion for fiscal year 2022–23 and, increased 9.8% than previous fiscal year. India is the world's second largest arms importer; between 2016 and 2020, it accounted for 9.5% of the total global arms imports. Much of the military expenditure was focused on defence against Pakistan and countering growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean. In May 2017, the ||Indian_Space_Research_Organisation|| launched the ||South_Asia_Satellite||, a gift from India to its neighbouring ||SAARC|| countries. In October 2018, India signed a US$5.43 billion (over ||Indian_rupee||400 billion) agreement with ||Russia|| to procure four ||S-400_Triumf|| surface-to-air missile defence systems, Russia's most advanced long-range ||Missile_defence|| system.

According to the ||International_Monetary_Fund|| (IMF), the Indian economy in 2020 was nominally worth $2.7 trillion; it is the ||List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)|| by market exchange rates, and is around $8.9 trillion, the ||List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)|| by ||Purchasing_power_parity|| (PPP). With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–2012, India is one of the ||List_of_countries_by_real_GDP_growth_rate||. However, the country ranks 139th in the world in ||List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita|| and 118th in ||List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita||. Until 1991, all Indian governments followed ||Protectionism|| policies that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread ||Licence_Raj|| largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute ||1991_India_economic_crisis|| forced the nation to ||Economic_liberalisation_in_India||; since then it has moved slowly towards a free-market system by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows. India has been a member of ||WTO|| since 1 January 1995. The 522-million-worker ||Labour_in_India|| is the ||List_of_countries_by_labour_force||, as of 2017. The service sector makes up 55.6% of GDP, the industrial sector 26.3% and the agricultural sector 18.1%. India's ||Remittance|| of US$87 billion in 2021, highest in the world, were contributed to its economy by 32 million Indians working in foreign countries. Major agricultural products include: rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, and potatoes. Major industries include: textiles, telecommunications, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, food processing, steel, transport equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery, and software. In 2006, the share of external trade in India's GDP stood at 24%, up from 6% in 1985. In 2008, India's share of world trade was 1.68%; In 2011, India was the world's ||List_of_countries_by_imports|| and the ||List_of_countries_by_exports||. Major exports include: petroleum products, textile goods, jewellery, software, engineering goods, chemicals, and manufactured leather goods. Major imports include: crude oil, machinery, gems, fertiliser, and chemicals. Between 2001 and 2011, the contribution of petrochemical and engineering goods to total exports grew from 14% to 42%. India was the world's second largest textile exporter after ||China|| in the 2013 calendar year. Averaging an economic growth rate of 7.5% for several years prior to 2007, India has more than doubled its hourly wage rates during the first decade of the 21st century. Some 431 million Indians have left poverty since 1985; India's middle classes are projected to number around 580 million by 2030. Though ranking 51st in ||Global_Competitiveness_Report||, as of 2010, India ranks 17th in financial market sophistication, 24th in the banking sector, 44th in business sophistication, and 39th in innovation, ahead of several advanced economies. With seven of the world's top 15 information technology outsourcing companies based in India, as of 2009, the country is viewed as the second-most favourable outsourcing destination after the United States. India was ranked 46th in the ||Global_Innovation_Index|| in 2021, it has increased its ranking considerably since 2015, where it was 81st. India's consumer market, the world's ||List_of_largest_consumer_markets||, is expected to become fifth-largest by 2030. Driven by growth, India's nominal ||GDP_per_capita|| increased steadily from US$308 in 1991, when economic liberalisation began, to US$1,380 in 2010, to an estimated US$1,730 in 2016. It is expected to grow to US$2,313 by 2022. However, it has remained lower than those of other Asian developing countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, and is expected to remain so in the near future. A panorama of ||Bangalore||, the centre of India's software development economy. In the 1980s, when the first ||Multinational_corporation|| began to set up centres in India, they chose Bangalore because of the large pool of skilled graduates in the area, in turn due to the many science and engineering colleges in the surrounding region. According to a 2011 ||PricewaterhouseCoopers|| (PwC) report, India's GDP at purchasing power parity could overtake that of the United States by 2045. During the next four decades, Indian GDP is expected to grow at an annualised average of 8%, making it potentially the world's fastest-growing major economy until 2050. The report highlights key growth factors: a young and rapidly growing working-age population; growth in the manufacturing sector because of rising education and engineering skill levels; and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle-class. The World Bank cautions that, for India to achieve its economic potential, it must continue to focus on public sector reform, ||Transport_in_India||, agricultural and rural development, removal of labour regulations, ||Education_in_India||, ||Energy_policy_of_India||, and ||Healthcare_in_India|| and nutrition. According to the Worldwide Cost of Living Report 2017 released by the ||Economist_Intelligence_Unit|| (EIU) which was created by comparing more than 400 individual prices across 160 products and services, four of the cheapest cities were in India: ||Bangalore|| (3rd), ||Mumbai|| (5th), ||Chennai|| (5th) and ||New_Delhi|| (8th).

As of 2021, with 3000 pharmaceutical companies and 10,500 manufacturing units India is the world's third-largest pharmaceutical producer, largest producer of generic medicines and supply up to 50%—60% of global vaccines demand, these all contribute up to US$24.44 billions in exports and India's local pharmacutical market is estimated up to US$42 billion. India is among the top 12 biotech destinations in the world. The Indian biotech industry grew by 15.1% in 2012–2013, increasing its revenues from ₹204.4 billion (||Indian_rupee||) to ₹235.24 billion (US$3.94 billion at June 2013 exchange rates).

Eight years later, and three years after India's last case of polio, the ||World_Health_Organization|| declared India to be polio-free. Despite economic growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-economic challenges. In 2006, India contained the ||Poverty_in_India|| of people living below the World Bank's international poverty line of US$1.25 per day. The proportion decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005. Under the World Bank's later revised poverty line, it was 21% in 2011. 30.7% of India's children under the age of five are underweight. According to a ||Food_and_Agriculture_Organization|| report in 2015, 15% of the population is undernourished. The ||Mid-Day_Meal_Scheme|| attempts to lower these rates. According to a 2016 ||Walk_Free_Foundation|| report there were an estimated 18.3 million people in India, or 1.4% of the population, living in the forms of ||Modern_slavery||, such as ||Bonded_labour||, ||Child_labour||, human trafficking, and forced begging, among others. According to the 2011 census, there were 10.1 million child labourers in the country, a decline of 2.6 million from 12.6 million in 2001. Since 1991, ||List_of_Indian_states_by_GDP|| between India's states has consistently grown: the per-capita ||Net_domestic_product|| of the richest states in 2007 was 3.2 times that of the poorest. ||Corruption_in_India|| is perceived to have decreased. According to the ||Corruption_Perceptions_Index||, India ranked 78th out of 180 countries in 2018 with a score of 41 out of 100, an improvement from 85th in 2014. Demographics, languages, and religion Main articles: ||Demographics_of_India||, ||Languages_of_India||, and ||Religion_in_India|| See also: ||South_Asian_ethnic_groups|| India by languageThe language families of South Asia With 1,210,193,422 residents reported in the ||2011_Census_of_India||, India is the world's second-most populous country. Its population grew by 17.64% from 2001 to 2011, compared to 21.54% growth in the previous decade (1991–2001). The human sex ratio, according to the 2011 census, is 940 females per 1,000 males. The median age was 28.7 as of 2020. The first post-colonial census, conducted in 1951, counted 361 million people. Medical advances made in the last 50 years as well as increased agricultural productivity brought about by the "||Green_Revolution_in_India||" have caused India's population to grow rapidly. The average life expectancy in India is at 70 years—71.5 years for women, 68.7 years for men. There are around 93 physicians per 100,000 people. Migration from rural to urban areas has been an important dynamic in India's recent history. The number of people living in urban areas grew by 31.2% between 1991 and 2001. Yet, in 2001, over 70% still lived in rural areas. The level of urbanisation increased further from 27.81% in the 2001 Census to 31.16% in the 2011 Census. The slowing down of the overall population growth rate was due to the sharp decline in the growth rate in rural areas since 1991. According to the 2011 census, there are 53 ||List_of_million-plus_urban_agglomerations_in_India||; among them ||Mumbai||, ||Delhi||, ||Kolkata||, ||Chennai||, ||Bangalore||, ||Hyderabad|| and ||Ahmedabad||, in decreasing order by population. The literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04%: 65.46% among females and 82.14% among males. The rural-urban literacy gap, which was 21.2 percentage points in 2001, dropped to 16.1 percentage points in 2011. The improvement in the rural literacy rate is twice that of urban areas. ||Kerala|| is the most literate state with 93.91% literacy; while ||Bihar|| the least with 63.82%.

Christianity is believed to have been introduced to India by the late 2nd century by ||Christianity_in_India#Early_Christianity_in_India||. India is home to ||Languages_of_India||: ||Indo-Aryan_languages|| (spoken by about 74% of the population) and ||Dravidian_languages|| (spoken by 24% of the population). Other languages spoken in India come from the ||Austroasiatic_languages|| and ||Sino-Tibetan_languages|| language families. India has no national language. ||Hindi||, with the largest number of speakers, is the official language of the government. ||English_language|| is used extensively in business and administration and has the status of a "subsidiary official language"; it is important in ||Education_in_India||, especially as a medium of higher education. Each state and union territory has one or more official languages, and the constitution recognises in particular 22 "scheduled languages". The 2011 census reported the ||Religion_in_India|| with the largest number of followers was ||Hinduism_in_India|| (79.80% of the population), followed by ||Islam_in_India|| (14.23%); the remaining were ||Christianity_in_India|| (2.30%), ||Sikhism_in_India|| (1.72%), ||History_of_Buddhism_in_India|| (0.70%), ||Statistics_of_Jainism|| (0.36%) and others (0.9%). India has the ||List_of_countries_by_Muslim_population#List|| Muslim population—the largest for a non-Muslim majority country. Culture Main article: ||Culture_of_India|| A Sikh pilgrim at the ||Harmandir_Sahib||, or Golden Temple, in ||Amritsar||, Punjab Indian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years. During the ||Vedic_period|| (c. 1700 BCE – c. 500 BCE), the foundations of ||Hindu_philosophy||, ||Hindu_mythology||, ||Hindu_theology|| and ||Hindu_texts|| were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as ||Dharma||, ||Karma||, ||Yoga||, and ||Moksha||, were established. India is notable for its ||Indian_religions||, with ||Hinduism||, ||Buddhism||, ||Sikhism||, ||Islam||, ||Christianity||, and ||Jainism|| among the nation's major religions. The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the ||Upanishads||, the ||Yoga_Sutras_of_Patanjali||, the ||Bhakti||, and by ||Buddhist_philosophy||. Visual art Main article: ||Indian_art|| South Asia has an ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged influences with the parts of ||Eurasia||. ||Indus_Valley_Civilisation#Seals|| from the third millennium BCE ||Indus_Valley_Civilization|| of ||Pakistan|| and northern India have been found, usually carved with animals, but a few with human figures. The , excavated in ||Mohenjo-daro||, Pakistan, in 1928–29, is the best known. After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving. Almost all surviving ancient Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious ||Indian_sculpture|| in durable materials, or coins. There was probably originally far more in wood, which is lost. In north India ||Mauryan_art|| is the first imperial movement. In the first millennium CE, ||Buddhist_art|| spread with Indian religions to ||Central_Asia||, ||East_Asia|| and ||South-East_Asia||, the last also greatly influenced by ||Hindu_art||. Over the following centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed, with less interest in articulating precise anatomy than ||Ancient_Greek_sculpture|| but showing smoothly-flowing forms expressing prana ("breath" or life-force). This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads, or represent different genders on the left and right of figures, as with the ||Ardhanarishvara|| form of Shiva and ||Parvati||. Most of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist, either excavated from Buddhist ||Stupa|| such as ||Sanchi||, ||Sarnath|| and ||Amaravati_Stupa||, or is rock-cut ||Relief|| at sites such as ||Ajanta_Caves||, ||Karla_Caves|| and ||Ellora||. Hindu and Jain sites appear rather later. In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups, and sculptors probably usually served all communities. ||Gupta_art||, at its peak c. 300 CE – c. 500 CE, is often regarded as a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after; it saw a new dominance of Hindu sculpture, as at the ||Elephanta_Caves||. Across the north, this became rather stiff and formulaic after c. 800 CE, though rich with finely carved detail in the surrounds of statues. But in the South, under the ||Pallava_dynasty|| and ||Chola_dynasty||, sculpture in both stone and bronze had a ||Chola_art_and_architecture#Sculpture_and_bronzes||; the large bronzes with Shiva as ||Nataraja|| have become an iconic symbol of India. Ancient painting has only survived at a few sites, of which the crowded scenes of court life in the ||Ajanta_Caves|| are by far the most important, but it was evidently highly developed, and is mentioned as a courtly accomplishment in Gupta times. Painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from Eastern India about the 10th century onwards, most of the earliest being Buddhist and later Jain. No doubt the style of these was used in larger paintings. The Persian-derived ||Deccan_painting||, starting just before the ||Mughal_miniature||, between them give the first large body of secular painting, with an emphasis on portraits, and the recording of princely pleasures and wars. The style spread to Hindu courts, especially ||Rajput_painting||, and developed a variety of styles, with the smaller courts often the most innovative, with figures such as ||Nih%C3%A2l_Chand|| and ||Nainsukh||. As a market developed among European residents, it was supplied by ||Company_painting|| by Indian artists with considerable Western influence. In the 19th century, cheap ||Kalighat_painting|| of gods and everyday life, done on paper, were urban ||Folk_art|| from ||Calcutta||, which later saw the ||Bengal_School_of_Art||, reflecting the art colleges founded by the British, the first movement in ||Modern_Indian_painting||.       ||Bhutesvara_Yakshis||, Buddhist reliefs from ||Mathura||, 2nd century CE           ||Gupta_art|| ||Terracotta|| relief, ||Krishna|| Killing the ||Keshi_(demon)||, 5th century           ||Elephanta_Caves||, triple-||Bust_(sculpture)|| (trimurti) of Shiva, 18 feet (5.5 m) tall, c. 550           ||Chola_bronze|| of ||Shiva|| as ||Nataraja|| ("Lord of Dance"), ||Tamil_Nadu||, 10th or 11th century.           ||Jahangir|| Receives ||Shah_Jahan|| at ||Ajmer|| on His Return from the ||Mewar|| Campaign, Balchand, c. 1635           Krishna Fluting to the Milkmaids, ||Kangra_painting||, 1775–1785     Architecture Main article: ||Architecture_of_India|| The Taj Mahal from across the ||Yamuna_river|| showing two outlying red sandstone buildings, a mosque on the right (west) and a jawab (response) thought to have been built for architectural balance. Much of ||Architecture_of_India||, including the ||Taj_Mahal||, other works of ||Mughal_architecture||, and ||Dravidian_architecture||, blends ancient local traditions with imported styles. ||Indian_vernacular_architecture|| is also regional in its flavours. ||Vastu_shastra||, literally "science of construction" or "architecture" and ascribed to ||Mamuni_Mayan||, explores how the laws of nature affect human dwellings; it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic constructs. As applied in ||Hindu_temple_architecture||, it is influenced by the ||Shilpa_Shastras||, a series of foundational texts whose basic mythological form is the Vastu-Purusha mandala, a square that embodied the "||Absolute_(philosophy)||". The Taj Mahal, built in ||Agra|| between 1631 and 1648 by orders of ||Mughal_emperors|| ||Shah_Jahan|| in memory of his wife, has been described in the ||UNESCO_World_Heritage_List|| as "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". ||Indo-Saracenic_Revival_architecture||, developed by the British in the late 19th century, drew on ||Indo-Islamic_architecture||. Literature Main article: ||Indian_literature|| The earliest literature in India, composed between 1500 BCE and 1200 CE, was in the ||Sanskrit|| language. Major works of ||Sanskrit_literature|| include the ||Rigveda|| (c. 1500 BCE – c. 1200 BCE), the ||Indian_epic_poetry||: ||Mahabharata|| ( c. 400 BCE – c. 400 CE) and the ||Ramayana|| ( c. 300 BCE and later); Abhijñānaśākuntalam (||The_Recognition_of_%C5%9Aakuntal%C4%81||, and other dramas of ||K%C4%81lid%C4%81sa|| ( c. 5th century CE) and ||Sanskrit_Classical_poetry|| poetry. In ||Tamil_literature||, the ||Sangam_literature|| (c. 600 BCE – c. 300 BCE) consisting of 2,381 poems, composed by 473 poets, is the earliest work. From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India's literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of ||Bhakti_movement|| like ||Kabir||, ||Tulsidas||, and ||Guru_Nanak||. This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions. In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the ||Works_of_Rabindranath_Tagore|| of the Bengali poet, author and philosopher ||Rabindranath_Tagore||, who was a recipient of the ||Nobel_Prize_in_Literature||. Performing arts and media Main articles: ||Music_of_India||, ||Dance_in_India||, ||Cinema_of_India||, and ||Television_in_India|| India's ||Sangeet_Natak_Akademi|| has recognised eight Indian dance styles to be classical. One such is ||Kuchipudi|| shown here. ||Music_of_India|| ranges over various traditions and regional styles. ||Indian_classical_music|| encompasses two genres and their various folk offshoots: the northern ||Hindustani_classical_music|| and southern ||Carnatic_music|| schools. Regionalised popular forms include ||Filmi|| and ||Indian_folk_music||; the ||Syncretism|| tradition of the ||Baul|| is a well-known form of the latter. ||Dance_in_India|| also features diverse folk and classical forms. Among the better-known ||List_of_Indian_folk_dances|| are: the ||Bhangra_(dance)|| of Punjab, the ||Bihu_dance|| of Assam, the ||Jhumair|| and ||Chhau_dance|| of Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal, ||Garba_(dance)|| and ||Dandiya_Raas|| of Gujarat, ||Ghoomar|| of Rajasthan, and the ||Lavani|| of Maharashtra. Eight dance forms, many with narrative forms and mythological elements, have been accorded ||Classical_Indian_dance|| by India's ||Sangeet_Natak_Akademi||. These are: ||Bharata_Natyam|| of the state of Tamil Nadu, ||Kathak|| of Uttar Pradesh, ||Kathakali|| and ||Mohiniyattam|| of Kerala, ||Kuchipudi|| of Andhra Pradesh, ||Manipuri_dance|| of Manipur, ||Odissi|| of Odisha, and the ||Sattriya|| of Assam. ||Theatre_in_India|| melds music, dance, and improvised or written dialogue. Often based on Hindu mythology, but also borrowing from medieval romances or social and political events, Indian theatre includes: the ||Bhavai|| of Gujarat, the ||Jatra_(Bengal)|| of West Bengal, the ||Nautanki|| and ||Ramlila|| of North India, ||Tamasha|| of Maharashtra, ||Burrakatha|| of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, ||Terukkuttu|| of Tamil Nadu, and the ||Yakshagana|| of Karnataka. India has a theatre training institute the ||National_School_of_Drama|| (NSD) that is situated at ||New_Delhi|| It is an autonomous organisation under the ||Ministry_of_Culture_(India)||, ||Government_of_India||. The ||Cinema_of_India|| produces the world's most-watched cinema. Established regional cinematic traditions exist in the ||Cinema_of_Assam||, ||Cinema_of_West_Bengal||, ||Bhojpuri_cinema||, ||Bollywood||, ||Cinema_of_Karnataka||, ||Malayalam_cinema||, ||Cinema_of_Punjab||, ||Gujarati_cinema||, ||Marathi_cinema||, ||Cinema_of_Odisha||, ||Tamil_cinema||, and ||Telugu_cinema|| languages. The Hindi language film industry (Bollywood) is the largest sector representing 43% of box office revenue, followed by the ||Cinema_of_South_India|| Telugu and Tamil film industries which represent 36% combined. Television broadcasting began in India in 1959 as a state-run medium of communication and expanded slowly for more than two decades. The ||Doordarshan|| on television broadcast ended in the 1990s. Since then, satellite channels have increasingly shaped the popular culture of Indian society. Today, television is the most penetrative media in India; industry estimates indicate that as of 2012 there are over 554 million TV consumers, 462 million with satellite or cable connections compared to other forms of mass media such as the press (350 million), radio (156 million) or internet (37 million). Society Main article: ||Culture_of_India|| Muslims offer ||Salah|| at a mosque in ||Srinagar||, Jammu and Kashmir. Traditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The ||Caste_system_in_India|| embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found on the Indian subcontinent. Social classes are defined by thousands of ||Endogamous|| hereditary groups, often termed as ||J%C4%81ti||, or "castes". India declared ||Untouchability|| to be illegal in 1947 and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives. ||Family_values|| are important in the Indian tradition, and multi-generational ||Patrilineal|| ||Joint_family|| have been the norm in India, though ||Nuclear_family|| are becoming common in urban areas. An overwhelming majority of Indians, with their consent, have ||Arranged_marriage_in_the_Indian_subcontinent|| by their parents or other family elders. Marriage is thought to be for life, and the divorce rate is extremely low, with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce. ||Child_marriage|| are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age. ||Female_infanticide_in_India||, and lately ||Female_foeticide_in_India||, have created skewed gender ratios; the number of ||Missing_women|| in the country quadrupled from 15 million to 63 million in the 50-year period ending in 2014, faster than the population growth during the same period, and constituting 20 percent of India's female electorate. Accord to an Indian government study, an additional 21 million girls are unwanted and do not receive adequate care. Despite a government ban on sex-selective foeticide, the practice remains commonplace in India, the result of a preference for boys in a patriarchal society. The payment of ||Dowry_system_in_India||, although ||Dowry_law_in_India||, remains widespread across class lines. ||Dowry_deaths||, mostly from ||Bride_burning||, are on the rise, despite stringent anti-dowry laws. Many ||Public_holidays_in_India|| are religious in origin. The best known include: ||Diwali||, ||Ganesh_Chaturthi||, ||Thai_Pongal||, ||Holi||, ||Durga_Puja||, ||Eid_ul-Fitr||, ||Bakr-Id||, ||Christmas_worldwide#India||, and ||Vaisakhi||.

The salutation ||Jai_Bhim|| written on the blackboard honours the jurist, social reformer, and ||Dalit|| leader ||B._R._Ambedkar||. In the 2011 census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for men and 65% for women. This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%. In 1921 the rates 7%, 12% and 2%. In 1891 they were 5%, 9% and 1%, According to Latika Chaudhary, in 1911 there were under three primary schools for every ten villages. Statistically, more caste and religious diversity reduced private spending. Primary schools taught literacy, so local diversity limited its growth. The education system of India is the world's second-largest. India has over 900 universities, 40,000 colleges and 1.5 million schools. In India's higher education system, a significant number of seats are reserved under ||Reservation_in_India|| policies for the historically disadvantaged. In recent decades India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its ||Economic_development_in_India||. Clothing Main article: ||Clothing_in_India|| Women in ||Sari|| at an adult literacy class in ||Tamil_Nadu||A man in ||Dhoti|| and wearing a woollen shawl, in ||Varanasi|| From ancient times until the advent of the modern, the most widely worn traditional dress in India was draped. For women it took the form of a ||Sari||, a single piece of cloth many yards long. The sari was traditionally wrapped around the lower body and the shoulder. In its modern form, it is combined with an underskirt, or Indian ||Petticoat#Asian_petticoats||, and tucked in the waist band for more secure fastening. It is also commonly worn with an Indian ||Blouse||, or ||Choli||, which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari's end—passing over the shoulder—serving to cover the midriff and obscure the upper body's contours. For men, a similar but shorter length of cloth, the ||Dhoti||, has served as a lower-body garment. Women (from left to right) in ||Churidar|| and ||Kameez|| (with back to the camera), jeans and sweater, and pink ||Shalwar_kameez||; The use of stitched clothes became widespread after Muslim rule was established at first by the ||Delhi_sultanate|| (ca 1300 CE) and then continued by the ||Mughal_Empire|| (ca 1525 CE). Among the garments introduced during this time and still commonly worn are: the ||Shalwar|| and ||Pyjama||, both styles of trousers, and the tunics ||Kurta|| and ||Kameez||. In southern India, the traditional draped garments were to see much longer continuous use. Shalwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom. They are held up by a drawstring, which causes them to become pleated around the waist. The pants can be wide and baggy, or they can be cut quite narrow, on the ||Grain_(textile)#Bias||, in which case they are called ||Churidar||. When they are ordinarily wide at the waist and their bottoms are hemmed but not cuffed, they are called pyjamas. The kameez is a long shirt or tunic, its side seams left open below the waist-line. The ||Kurta|| is traditionally collarless and made of cotton or silk; it is worn plain or with embroidered decoration, such as ||Chikan_(embroidery)||; and typically falls to either just above or just below the wearer's knees. In the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in India. Increasingly, in urban northern India, the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear, though they remain popular on formal occasions. The traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn by younger urban women, who favour churidars or jeans. In white-collar office settings, ubiquitous air conditioning allows men to wear sports jackets year-round. For weddings and formal occasions, men in the middle- and upper classes often wear ||Bandgala||, or short ||Nehru_jackets||, with pants, with the groom and his ||Groomsmen|| sporting ||Sherwani|| and churidars. The dhoti, once the universal garment of Hindu males, the wearing of which in the homespun and handwoven ||Khadi|| allowed Gandhi to bring Indian nationalism to the millions, is seldom seen in the cities. Cuisine Main article: ||Indian_cuisine|| South Indian vegetarian ||Thali||, or platter||Mutton_curry|| from ||Odisha|| The foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked in a plain fashion and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes. The cooked cereal could be steamed rice; ||Chapati||, a thin unleavened bread made from wheat flour, or occasionally cornmeal, and griddle-cooked dry; the ||Idli||, a steamed breakfast cake, or ||Dosa||, a griddled pancake, both leavened and made from a batter of rice- and ||Vigna_mungo|| meal. The savoury dishes might include ||Lentil||, ||Pulses|| and vegetables commonly spiced with ||Ginger_root|| and ||Garlic||, but also with a combination of spices that may include ||Coriander||, ||Cumin||, ||Turmeric||, ||Cinnamon||, ||Cardamon|| and others as informed by culinary conventions. They might also include poultry, fish, or meat dishes. In some instances, the ingredients might be mixed during the process of cooking. A platter, or ||Thali||, used for eating usually has a central place reserved for the cooked cereal, and peripheral ones for the flavourful accompaniments, which are often served in small bowls. The cereal and its accompaniments are eaten simultaneously rather than a piecemeal manner. This is accomplished by mixing—for example of rice and lentils—or folding, wrapping, scooping or dipping—such as chapati and cooked vegetables or lentils.  A tandoor chef in the ||Turkman_Gate||, ||Old_Delhi||, makes Khameeri ||Roti|| (a Muslim-influenced style of ||Bread#Leavening||). India has distinctive vegetarian cuisines, each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents. The appearance of ||Ahimsa||, or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many religious orders early in Indian history, especially ||Upanishads||, ||Buddhism|| and ||Jainism||, is thought to have contributed to the predominance of vegetarianism among a large segment of India's Hindu population, especially in southern India, Gujarat, the ||Hindi||-speaking belt of north-central India, as well as among Jains. Although meat is eaten widely in India, the proportional consumption of meat in the overall diet is low. Unlike China, which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of increased economic growth, in India the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy, rather than meat, becoming the preferred form of animal protein consumption. The most significant import of cooking techniques into India during the last millennium occurred during the ||Mughal_Empire||. Dishes such as the ||Pilaf||, developed in the ||Abbasid_caliphate||, and cooking techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt, spread into northern India from regions to its northwest. To the simple yogurt marinade of Persia, onions, garlic, almonds, and spices began to be added in India. Rice was partially cooked and layered alternately with the sauteed meat, the pot sealed tightly, and slow cooked according to another Persian cooking technique, to produce what has today become the Indian ||Biryani||, a feature of festive dining in many parts of India. In the food served in Indian restaurants worldwide the diversity of Indian food has been partially concealed by the dominance of ||Punjabi_cuisine||. The popularity of ||Tandoori_chicken||—cooked in the ||Tandoor|| oven, which had traditionally been used for baking bread in the rural Punjab and the Delhi region, especially among Muslims, but which is originally from ||Central_Asia||—dates to the 1950s, and was caused in large part by an entrepreneurial response among people from the Punjab who had been displaced by the 1947 ||Partition_of_India||. Sports and recreation Main article: ||Sport_in_India|| Girls play ||Hopscotch|| in ||Jaora||, Madhya Pradesh. Hopscotch has been commonly played by girls in rural India.

"A Chinese pilgrim also recorded evidence of the caste system as he could observe it. According to this evidence the treatment meted out to untouchables such as the Chandalas was very similar to that which they experienced in later periods. This would contradict assertions that this rigid form of the caste system emerged in India only as a reaction to the Islamic conquest."  "Shah Jahan eventually sent her body 800 km (500 mi) to Agra for burial in the Rauza-i Munauwara ("Illuminated Tomb") – a personal tribute and a stone manifestation of his imperial power.

(The Rigveda) consists of 1,028 hymns (suktas), highly crafted poetic compositions originally intended for recital during rituals and for the invocation of and communication with the Indo-Aryan gods. Modern scholarly opinion largely agrees that these hymns were composed between around 1500 BCE and 1200 BCE, during the eastward migration of the Indo-Aryan tribes from the mountains of what is today northern Afghanistan across the Punjab into north India.  (a) ||Michael_Witzel|| (2008). . In Gavin Flood (ed.). The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism. ||John_Wiley_%26_Sons||. pp. 68–70. ||ISBN_(identifier)|| . It is known from internal evidence that the Vedic texts were orally composed in northern India, at first in the Greater Punjab and later on also in more eastern areas, including northern Bihar, between ca. 1500 BCE and ca. 500–400 BCE. The oldest text, the Rgveda, must have been more or less contemporary with the Mitanni texts of northern Syria/Iraq (1450–1350 BCE); ... The Vedic texts were orally composed and transmitted, without the use of script, in an unbroken line of transmission from teacher to student that was formalized early on. This ensured an impeccable textual transmission superior to the classical texts of other cultures; it is in fact something of a tape-recording of ca. 1500–500 BCE. Not just the actual words, but even the long-lost musical (tonal) accent (as in old Greek or in Japanese) has been preserved up to the present. (pp. 68–69) ... The RV text was composed before the introduction and massive use of iron, that is before ca. 1200–1000 BCE.

The culture is called Aryan, and evidence in its texts indicates that it spread slowly south-east, following the course of the Yamuna and Ganga Rivers. Its elite called itself Arya (pure) and distinguished themselves sharply from others. Aryans led kin groups organized as nomadic horse-herding tribes. Their ritual texts are called Vedas, composed in Sanskrit. ||Vedic_Sanskrit|| is recorded only in hymns that were part of Vedic rituals to Aryan gods. To be Aryan apparently meant to belong to the elite among pastoral tribes. Texts that record Aryan culture are not precisely datable, but they seem to begin around 1200 BCE with four collections of Vedic hymns (Rg, Sama, Yajur, and Artharva)." (d) , pp. , "Although the collapse of the Indus valley civilization is no longer believed to have been due to an ‘Aryan invasion’ it is widely thought that, at roughly the same time, or perhaps a few centuries later, new Indo-Aryan-speaking people and influences began to enter the subcontinent from the north-west. Detailed evidence is lacking. Nevertheless, a predecessor of the language that would eventually be called Sanskrit was probably introduced into the north-west sometime between 3,900 and 3,000 years ago. This language was related to one then spoken in eastern Iran; and both of these languages belonged to the Indo-European language family. ... It seems likely that various small-scale migrations were involved in the gradual introduction of the predecessor language and associated cultural characteristics. However, there may not have been a tight relationship between movements of people on the one hand, and changes in language and culture on the other. Moreover, the process whereby a dynamic new force gradually arose—a people with a distinct ideology who eventually seem to have referred to themselves as ‘Arya’—was certainly two-way. That is, it involved a blending of new features which came from outside with other features—probably including some surviving Harappan influences—that were already present. Anyhow, it would be quite a few centuries before Sanskrit was written down. And the hymns and stories of the Arya people—especially the Vedas and the later Mahabharata and Ramayana epics—are poor guides as to historical events. Of course, the emerging Arya were to have a huge impact on the history of the subcontinent. Nevertheless, little is known about their early presence."; (e) , pp. , "The expansion of Aryan culture is supposed to have begun around 1500 BCE. It should not be thought that this Aryan emergence (though it implies some migration) necessarily meant either a sudden invasion of new peoples, or a complete break with earlier traditions. It comprises a set of cultural ideas and practices, upheld by a Sanskrit-speaking elite, or Aryans. The features of this society are recorded in the Vedas."

Almost all traditional Hindu families observe until today at least three samskaras (initiation, marriage, and death ritual). Most other rituals have lost their popularity, are combined with other rites of passage, or are drastically shortened. Although samskaras vary from region to region, from class (varna) to class, and from caste to caste, their core elements remain the same owing to the common source, the Veda, and a common priestly tradition preserved by the Brahmin priests.

The PLA's decisive victories in the 1962 war not only humiliated the Indian Army, they also entrenched a status quo in Ladakh that was highly unfavourable for India, in which China controls almost all of the disputed territory. A nationalistic press and commentariat have kept 1962 vivid in India's popular consciousness. (c) Lintner, Bertil (2018), , Oxford University Press, ||ISBN_(identifier)|| ,  And that became a reality after the victory over India in 1962. Two years later, Nehru died, humiliated by the Chinese, a broken man. Brigadier Dalvi noted this in his account of the 1962 War and its aftermath, ‘Without a Nehru India ceased to be the moral leader of the non-aligned world. Whereas prior to 1962 she wielded immense power and influence despite her poverty and lack of military power, after the Chinese attack she was "cut to size" in the words of one unfriendly critic of Nehru.' (d) Medcalf, Rory (2020), , Manchester University Press, ||ISBN_(identifier)|| , From an Indian perspective, the China-India war of 1962 was a shocking betrayal of the principles of cooperation and coexistence: a surprise attack that humiliated India and personally broke Nehru.

The outcome of this conflict had far-reaching consequences for Indian foreign and defence policies. The harsh defeat that the Chinese PLA had inflicted on the Indian Army called into question some of the most deeply held precepts of Nehru's foreign and defence policies.

Jhala, Angma Day (2015), , Routledge, p. 70, ||ISBN_(identifier)|| , With the ascent of the Mughal Empire in sixteenth-century India, Turkic, Persian and Afghan traditions of dress, 'architecture and cuisine' were adopted by non-Muslim indigenous elites in South Asia. In this manner, Central Asian cooking merged with older traditions within the subcontinent, to create such signature dishes as biryani (a fusion of the Persian pilau and the spice-laden dishes of Hindustan), and the Kashmiri meat stew of Rogan Josh. It not only generated new dishes and entire cuisines, but also fostered novel modes of eating. Such newer trends included the consumption of Persian condiments, which relied heavily on almonds, pastries and quince jams, alongside Indian achars made from sweet limes, green vegetables and curds as side relishes during Mughlai meals.
