The United Kingdom includes the island of ||Great_Britain||, the north-­eastern part of the island of ||Ireland||, and many smaller islands within the ||British_Isles||. Northern Ireland shares ||Republic_of_Ireland%E2%80%93United_Kingdom_border|| with the ||Republic_of_Ireland||. Otherwise, the United Kingdom is surrounded by the ||Atlantic_Ocean||, with the ||North_Sea|| to the east, the ||English_Channel|| to the south and the ||Celtic_Sea|| to the south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The ||Irish_Sea|| separates Great Britain and Ireland. The total area of the United Kingdom is 93,628 square miles (242,500 km), with an estimated population in 2020 of over 67 million. The United Kingdom is a unitary ||Parliamentary_democracy|| and ||Constitutional_monarchy||. The monarch, ||Queen_Elizabeth_II||, has reigned since 1952. The capital and ||List_of_urban_areas_in_the_United_Kingdom|| is ||London||, a global city and financial centre with a metropolitan area population of 14 million. Other major cities include ||Birmingham||, ||Manchester||, ||Glasgow||, ||Liverpool|| and ||Leeds||. The United Kingdom consists of ||Countries_of_the_United_Kingdom||: ||England||, ||Scotland||, ||Wales|| and ||Northern_Ireland||. Other than England, the constituent countries have their own ||Devolution_in_the_United_Kingdom||, each with varying powers. The United Kingdom has evolved from a series of annexations, unions and separations of constituent countries over several hundred years. The ||Treaty_of_Union|| between the ||Kingdom_of_England|| (which included Wales, ||Laws_in_Wales_Acts_1535_and_1542||) and the ||Kingdom_of_Scotland|| in 1707 formed the ||Kingdom_of_Great_Britain||. Its ||Acts_of_Union_1800|| with the ||Kingdom_of_Ireland|| created the ||United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland||. Most of Ireland seceded from the UK in 1922, leaving the present United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which formally adopted that name in 1927. The nearby ||Isle_of_Man||, ||Bailiwick_of_Guernsey|| and ||Jersey|| are not part of the UK, being ||Crown_Dependencies|| with the ||British_Government|| responsible for defence and international representation. There are also 14 ||British_Overseas_Territories||, the last remnants of the ||British_Empire|| which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's landmass and a third of the world's population, and was the ||List_of_largest_empires#Empires_at_their_greatest_extent||. British influence can be observed in the language, culture and the legal and political systems of many of its ||List_of_countries_that_have_gained_independence_from_the_United_Kingdom||. The United Kingdom has the world's ||List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)|| (GDP), and the ||List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)|| (PPP). It has a high-income economy and a very high ||Human_Development_Index||, ranking 13th in the world. The UK became the world's first ||Industrialisation|| and was the world's ||Foremost_power|| during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Today the UK remains one of the world's ||Great_power||, with considerable economic, cultural, military, ||Science_and_technology_in_the_United_Kingdom|| and ||Politics_of_the_United_Kingdom|| influence internationally. It is a recognised ||Nuclear_state|| and is ranked ||List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures||. It has been a ||Permanent_members_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council|| of the ||United_Nations_Security_Council|| since its first session in 1946. The United Kingdom is a member of the ||Commonwealth_of_Nations||, the ||Council_of_Europe||, the ||G7||, the ||Group_of_Ten_(economics)||, the ||G-20_major_economies||, the ||United_Nations||, ||NATO||, ||AUKUS||, the ||Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development|| (OECD), ||Interpol||, and the ||World_Trade_Organization|| (WTO). It was a member state of the ||European_Communities|| (EC) and its successor, the ||European_Union|| (EU), from its ||Accession_of_the_United_Kingdom_to_the_European_Communities|| until its ||Brexit|| following a ||2016_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum|| held in 2016. Contents Etymology and terminology See also: ||Britain_(place_name)|| and ||Terminology_of_the_British_Isles|| The ||Acts_of_Union_1707|| declared that the ||Kingdom_of_England|| and ||Kingdom_of_Scotland|| were "United into One Kingdom by the Name of ||Kingdom_of_Great_Britain||". The term "United Kingdom" has occasionally been used as a description for the former kingdom of Great Britain, although its official name from 1707 to 1800 was simply "Great Britain". The ||Acts_of_Union_1800|| united the kingdoms of Great Britain and ||Kingdom_of_Ireland|| in 1801, forming the ||United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland||. Following the ||Partition_of_Ireland|| and the independence of the ||Irish_Free_State|| in 1922, which left ||Northern_Ireland|| as the only part of the island of Ireland within the United Kingdom, the name was changed to the "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland". Although the United Kingdom is a sovereign country, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also widely referred to as countries. The UK Prime Minister's website has used the phrase "countries within a country" to describe the United Kingdom. Some statistical summaries, such as those for the twelve ||NUTS_of_the_United_Kingdom|| refer to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as "regions". Northern Ireland is also referred to as a "province". With regard to Northern Ireland, the descriptive name used "can be controversial, with the choice often revealing one's political preferences". The term "Great Britain" conventionally refers to the island of Great Britain, or politically to England, Scotland and Wales in combination. It is sometimes used as a loose synonym for the United Kingdom as a whole. The ||Britain_(place_name)|| is used both as a synonym for Great Britain, and as a synonym for the United Kingdom. Usage is mixed: the UK Government prefers to use the term "UK" rather than "Britain" or "British" on its own website (except when referring to embassies), while acknowledging that both terms refer to the United Kingdom and that elsewhere "British government" is used at least as frequently as "United Kingdom government". The UK ||Permanent_Committee_on_Geographical_Names|| recognises "United Kingdom", "UK" and "U.K." as shortened and abbreviated geopolitical terms for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in its toponymic guidelines; it does not list "Britain" but notes that "it is only the one specific nominal term 'Great Britain' which invariably excludes Northern Ireland". The ||BBC|| historically preferred to use "Britain" as shorthand only for Great Britain, though the present style guide does not take a position except that "Great Britain" excludes Northern Ireland. The adjective "British" is commonly used to refer to matters relating to the United Kingdom and is used in law to refer to United Kingdom citizenship and ||British_nationality_law||. People of the United Kingdom use a number of different terms to describe their national identity and may identify themselves as being ||British_people||, ||English_people||, ||Scottish_people||, ||Welsh_people||, ||People_of_Northern_Ireland||, or ||Irish_people||; or as having a combination of different national identities. The official designation for a citizen of the United Kingdom is "British citizen". History Prior to the Treaty of Union Main articles: ||History_of_England||, ||History_of_Wales||, ||History_of_Scotland||, ||History_of_Ireland||, and ||History_of_the_formation_of_the_United_Kingdom|| See also: ||History_of_the_British_Isles||  ||Stonehenge|| is a ring of stones, each about 4 m (13 ft) high, 2 m (7 ft) wide and 25 ||Tonne||, erected 2400–2200 BC Settlement by ||Cro-Magnons|| of what was to become the United Kingdom occurred in waves beginning by about 30,000 years ago. By the end of the ||Prehistoric_Britain||, the population is thought to have belonged, in the main, to a culture termed ||Insular_Celts||, comprising ||Britons_(historical)|| and ||Gaelic_Ireland||. Prior to the ||Roman_conquest_of_Britain||, Britain was home to about 30 indigenous tribes. The largest were the ||Belgae||, the ||Brigantes||, the ||Silures|| and the ||Iceni||. Historian ||Edward_Gibbon|| believed that ||Spain||, ||Gaul|| and Britain were populated by "the same hardy race of savages", based on the similarity of their "manners and languages". The ||Roman_conquest_of_Britain||, beginning in 43 AD, and the 400-year ||Roman_Britain||, was followed by an invasion by ||Germanic_peoples|| ||Anglo-Saxon|| settlers, reducing the Brittonic area mainly ||Wales#Medieval_Wales||, ||Cornwall|| and, until the latter stages of the Anglo-Saxon settlement, the ||Hen_Ogledd|| (northern England and parts of southern Scotland). Most of the ||Anglo-Saxon_England|| became unified as the ||Kingdom_of_England|| in the 10th century. Meanwhile, ||D%C3%A1l_Riata|| (with connections to the north-east of Ireland and traditionally supposed to have migrated from there in the 5th century) united with the ||Picts|| to create the ||Kingdom_of_Scotland|| in the 9th century.  The ||Bayeux_Tapestry|| depicts the ||Battle_of_Hastings||, 1066, and the events leading to it. In 1066, the ||Normans|| and their ||Breton_people|| allies invaded England from northern France. After ||Norman_conquest_of_England||, they seized ||Norman_invasion_of_Wales||, ||Norman_invasion_of_Ireland|| and were invited to settle in Scotland, bringing to each country ||Feudalism|| on the Northern French model and ||Norman-French|| culture. The ||Anglo-Normans|| ||Ruling_class|| greatly influenced, but eventually assimilated with, each of the local cultures. Subsequent ||House_of_Plantagenet|| completed the ||Conquest_of_Wales|| and made unsuccessful ||Wars_of_Scottish_Independence||. Asserting its independence in the 1320 ||Declaration_of_Arbroath||, Scotland maintained its independence thereafter, albeit in ||Anglo-Scottish_Wars||. The English monarchs, through inheritance of ||Angevin_Empire|| and claims to the French crown, were also heavily involved in conflicts in France, most notably the ||Hundred_Years_War||, while the ||List_of_Scottish_monarchs|| were in ||Auld_Alliance|| during this period. ||Early_modern_Britain|| saw religious conflict resulting from the ||Reformation|| and the introduction of ||Protestant|| state churches in each country. Wales was ||Laws_in_Wales_Acts_1535%E2%80%931542||, and Ireland was constituted as a kingdom in personal union with the English crown. In what was to become Northern Ireland, the lands of the independent Catholic Gaelic nobility were confiscated and ||Plantation_of_Ulster|| from England and Scotland. In 1603, the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland were united in a ||Personal_union|| when ||James_I_of_England||, inherited the crowns of England and Ireland and moved his court from ||Edinburgh|| to London; each country nevertheless remained a separate political entity and retained its separate political, legal, and religious institutions. In the mid-17th century, all three kingdoms ||Wars_of_the_Three_Kingdoms|| (including the ||English_Civil_War||) which led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy, with the ||Execution_of_Charles_I||, and the establishment of the short-lived ||Unitary_republic|| of the ||Commonwealth_of_England||. During the 17th and 18th centuries, British sailors were involved in acts of ||Piracy|| (||Privateering||), attacking and stealing from ships off the coast of Europe and the Caribbean. Although the ||Restoration_(1660)||, the ||Interregnum_(1649%E2%80%931660)|| (along with the ||Glorious_Revolution|| of 1688 and the subsequent ||Bill_of_Rights_1689||, and the ||Claim_of_Right_Act_1689||) ensured that, unlike much of the rest of Europe, ||Royal_absolutism|| would not prevail, and a professed Catholic could never accede to the throne. The ||British_constitution|| would develop on the basis of ||Constitutional_monarchy|| and the ||Parliamentary_system||. With the founding of the ||Royal_Society|| in 1660, science was greatly encouraged. During this period, particularly in England, the development of ||English_navy|| and the interest in ||Age_of_Discovery|| led to the acquisition and settlement of ||First_British_Empire||, particularly in North America and the Caribbean. Though previous attempts at uniting the two kingdoms within Great Britain in 1606, 1667, and 1689 had proved unsuccessful, the attempt initiated in 1705 led to the ||Treaty_of_Union|| of 1706 being agreed and ratified by both parliaments. Kingdom of Great Britain Main article: ||Kingdom_of_Great_Britain||  The ||Treaty_of_Union|| led to a united kingdom of all of Great Britain. On 1 May 1707, the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed, the result of ||Acts_of_Union_1707|| being passed by the parliaments of England and Scotland to ratify the 1706 ||Treaty_of_Union|| and so unite the two kingdoms. In the 18th century, cabinet government developed under ||Robert_Walpole||, in practice the first prime minister (1721–1742). A series of ||Jacobite_Uprisings|| sought to remove the Protestant ||House_of_Hanover|| from the British throne and restore the Catholic ||House_of_Stuart||. The Jacobites were finally defeated at the ||Battle_of_Culloden|| in 1746, after which the ||Scottish_Highlanders|| were brutally suppressed. The British colonies in North America that broke away from Britain in the ||American_Revolutionary_War|| became the United States of America, recognised by Britain in 1783. British imperial ambition turned towards Asia, particularly to ||India||. Britain played a leading part in the ||Atlantic_slave_trade||, mainly between 1662 and 1807 when British or British-colonial ||Slave_ships|| transported nearly 3.3 million slaves from Africa. The slaves were taken to work on ||Plantation_economy|| in British possessions, principally in the ||History_of_the_British_West_Indies|| but also ||British_America||. Slavery coupled with the ||Sugar_plantations_in_the_Caribbean|| had a significant role in strengthening and developing the British economy in the 18th century. However, Parliament banned the trade in 1807, banned slavery in the British Empire in 1833, and Britain took a leading role in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide through the ||Blockade_of_Africa|| and pressing other nations to end their trade with a series of treaties. The world's oldest international human rights organisation, ||Anti-Slavery_International||, was formed in London in 1839. From the union with Ireland to the end of the First World War Main article: ||History_of_the_United_Kingdom||  At the ||Battle_of_Waterloo|| in 1815 a British-led coalition under the ||Duke_of_Wellington||, supported by ||Gebhard_Leberecht_von_Bl%C3%BCcher||'s Prussian army, defeated the French, ending the ||Napoleonic_Wars|| The term "United Kingdom" became official in 1801 when the parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland each passed an ||Acts_of_Union_(1800)||, uniting the two kingdoms and creating the ||United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland||. After the defeat of France at the end of the ||French_Revolutionary_Wars|| and ||Napoleonic_Wars|| (1792–1815), the United Kingdom emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the 19th century (with London the largest city in the world from about 1830). ||Royal_Navy#1815–1914||, British dominance was later described as ||Pax_Britannica|| ("British Peace"), a period of ||International_relations_of_the_Great_Powers_(1814%E2%80%931919)|| (1815–1914) during which the ||British_Empire|| became the global ||Hegemon|| and adopted the role of global policeman. By the time of ||The_Great_Exhibition|| of 1851, Britain was described as the "workshop of the world". From 1853 to 1856, Britain took part in the ||Crimean_War||, allied with the ||Ottoman_Empire|| in the fight against the ||Russian_Empire||, participating in the naval battles of the ||Baltic_Sea|| known as the in the ||Gulf_of_Bothnia|| and the ||Gulf_of_Finland||, among others. The British Empire was expanded to include ||British_Raj||, large ||British_Empire#Cape_to_Cairo|| and many other territories throughout the world. Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, British dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively ||Informal_Empire||, such as Asia and Latin America. Domestically, political attitudes favoured free trade and laissez-faire policies and a gradual widening of the voting franchise. During the century, the population increased at a dramatic rate, accompanied by rapid urbanisation, causing significant social and economic stresses. To seek new markets and sources of raw materials, the ||Conservative_Party_(UK)|| under ||Benjamin_Disraeli|| launched a period of imperialist expansion in Egypt, South Africa, and elsewhere. Canada, Australia and New Zealand became self-governing dominions. After the turn of the century, Britain's industrial dominance was challenged by Germany and the United States. Social reform and home rule for Ireland were important domestic issues after 1900. The ||Labour_Party_(UK)|| emerged from an alliance of trade unions and small socialist groups in 1900, and ||Suffragettes|| campaigned from before 1914 for women's right to vote.  Infantry of the ||Royal_Ulster_Rifles|| during the ||Battle_of_the_Somme||. More than 885,000 British soldiers died on the battlefields of the First World War. Britain fought alongside France, Russia and (after 1917) the United States, against Germany and its allies in the ||First_World_War|| (1914–1918). British armed forces were engaged across much of the British Empire and in several regions of Europe, particularly on the ||Western_Front_(World_War_I)||. The high fatalities of trench warfare caused the loss of much of a generation of men, with lasting social effects in the nation and a great disruption in the social order. After the war, Britain received the ||League_of_Nations|| mandate over a number of former German and ||Ottoman_Empire|| colonies. The British Empire reached its greatest extent, covering a fifth of the world's land surface and a quarter of its population. Britain had suffered 2.5 million casualties and finished the war with a huge national debt. Interwar years and the Second World War Main articles: ||Interwar_Britain||, ||Military_history_of_the_United_Kingdom_during_World_War_II||, and ||United_Kingdom_home_front_during_World_War_II|| By the mid-1920s most of the British population could listen to ||BBC|| radio programmes. Experimental television broadcasts ||History_of_television#United_Kingdom|| and the ||First_day_of_BBC_television|| commenced in 1936. The rise of ||Irish_nationalism||, and disputes within Ireland over the terms of ||Irish_Home_Rule_movement||, led eventually to the ||Partition_of_Ireland|| in 1921. The ||Irish_Free_State|| became independent, initially with ||Dominion|| status in 1922, and ||Statute_of_Westminster_1931#Irish_Free_State||. Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom. The ||Representation_of_the_People_(Equal_Franchise)_Act_1928|| widened ||Suffrage|| by giving women electoral equality with men. A wave of strikes in the mid-1920s culminated in the ||1926_United_Kingdom_general_strike||. Britain had still not recovered from the effects of the war when the ||Great_Depression_in_the_United_Kingdom|| (1929–1932) occurred. This led to considerable unemployment and hardship in the old industrial areas, as well as political and social unrest in the 1930s, with rising membership in communist and socialist parties. A coalition government was formed in 1931. Nonetheless, "Britain was a very wealthy country, formidable in arms, ruthless in pursuit of its interests and sitting at the heart of a global production system." After ||Nazi_Germany|| invaded Poland, Britain entered the ||Second_World_War|| by declaring war on Germany in 1939. ||Winston_Churchill|| became prime minister and head of a coalition government in 1940. Despite the defeat of its European allies in the first year of the war, Britain and its Empire continued the fight alone against Germany. Churchill engaged industry, scientists, and engineers to advise and support the government and the military in the prosecution of the war effort. In 1940, the ||Royal_Air_Force|| defeated the German ||Luftwaffe|| in a struggle for control of the skies in the ||Battle_of_Britain||. Urban areas suffered heavy bombing during ||The_Blitz||. The ||Grand_Alliance_(World_War_II)|| of Britain, the United States and the ||Soviet_Union|| formed in 1941 leading the ||Allies_of_World_War_II|| against the ||Axis_powers||. There were eventual hard-fought victories in the ||Battle_of_the_Atlantic||, the ||North_Africa_campaign|| and the ||Italian_campaign_(World_War_II)||. British forces played an important role in the ||Normandy_landings|| of 1944 and the ||Liberation_of_Europe||, achieved with its allies the United States, the Soviet Union and other Allied countries. The British Army led the ||Burma_campaign|| against Japan and the ||British_Pacific_Fleet|| fought Japan at sea.

Postwar 20th century Main articles: ||Postwar_Britain_(1945%E2%80%931979)|| and ||Social_history_of_Postwar_Britain_(1945%E2%80%931979)||  Territories once part of the ||British_Empire||, with the United Kingdom and its current ||British_Overseas_Territories|| and ||Crown_Dependencies|| underlined in red During the Second World War, the UK was one of the ||Big_Three_(World_War_II)|| powers (along with the U.S. and the Soviet Union) who met to plan the post-war world; it was an original signatory to the ||Declaration_by_United_Nations||. After the war, the UK became one of the five permanent members of the ||United_Nations_Security_Council|| and worked closely with the United States to establish the ||IMF||, ||World_Bank|| and ||NATO||. The war left the UK severely weakened and financially dependent on the ||Marshall_Plan||, but it was spared the total war that devastated eastern Europe. In the immediate post-war years, the ||Labour_Government_1945%E2%80%931951|| initiated a radical programme of reforms, which had a significant effect on British society in the following decades. Major industries and public utilities were ||Nationalization||, a ||Welfare_state|| was established, and a comprehensive, publicly funded healthcare system, the ||National_Health_Service||, was created. The rise of nationalism in the colonies coincided with Britain's now much-diminished economic position, so that a policy of ||Decolonisation|| was unavoidable. Independence was granted to India and Pakistan in 1947. Over the next three decades, most colonies of the British Empire gained their independence, with all those that sought independence supported by the UK, during both the transition period and afterwards. Many became members of the ||Commonwealth_of_Nations||. The UK was the third country to develop ||Nuclear_weapons_and_the_United_Kingdom|| (with its first atomic bomb test, ||Operation_Hurricane||, in 1952), but the new post-war limits of Britain's international role were illustrated by the ||Suez_Crisis|| of 1956. The ||English-speaking_world|| ensured the continuing international influence of its ||British_literature|| and ||Culture_of_the_United_Kingdom||. As a result of a shortage of workers in the 1950s, the government encouraged immigration from ||Commonwealth_countries||. In the following decades, the UK became a more multi-ethnic society than before. Despite rising living standards in the late 1950s and 1960s, the UK's economic performance was less successful than many of its main competitors such as France, ||West_Germany|| and Japan.  Leaders of ||European_Union|| states in 2007. The UK entered the ||European_Economic_Community|| in 1973. In a ||1975_United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum|| 67% voted to stay in it; in 2016 52% voted to leave the EU. In the decades-long process of ||European_integration||, the UK was a founding member of the alliance called the ||Western_European_Union||, established with the ||London_and_Paris_Conferences|| in 1954. In 1960 the UK was one of the seven founding members of the ||European_Free_Trade_Association|| (EFTA), but in 1973 it left to join the ||European_Communities|| (EC). When the EC became the ||European_Union|| (EU) in 1992, the UK was one of the 12 founding member states. The ||Treaty_of_Lisbon||, signed in 2007, forms the constitutional basis of the European Union since then. From the late 1960s, Northern Ireland suffered communal and paramilitary violence (sometimes affecting other parts of the UK) conventionally known as ||The_Troubles||. It is usually considered to have ended with the ||Belfast_Agreement|| of 1998. Following a period of widespread economic slowdown and industrial strife in the 1970s, the Conservative government of the 1980s under ||Margaret_Thatcher|| initiated a radical policy of ||Monetarism||, deregulation, particularly of the financial sector (for example, the ||Big_Bang_(financial_markets)|| in 1986) and labour markets, the sale of state-owned companies (privatisation), and the withdrawal of subsidies to others. From 1984, the economy was helped by the inflow of substantial ||North_Sea_oil|| revenues. Around the end of the 20th century, there were major changes to the governance of the UK with the establishment of ||Devolution|| administrations for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The ||Human_Rights_Act_1998|| followed acceptance of the ||European_Convention_on_Human_Rights||. The UK is still a key global player diplomatically and militarily. It plays leading roles in the UN and ||NATO||. 21st century Main articles: ||Political_history_of_the_United_Kingdom_(1979%E2%80%93present)|| and ||Social_history_of_the_United_Kingdom_(1979%E2%80%93present)|| The UK broadly supported the United States' approach to the ||War_on_terror|| in the early years of the 21st century. Controversy surrounded some of Britain's overseas military deployments, particularly in ||War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%932021)|| and ||Iraq_War||. The ||2008_global_financial_crisis|| severely affected the UK economy. The ||Cameron%E2%80%93Clegg_coalition|| government of 2010 introduced austerity measures intended to tackle the substantial public deficits which resulted. The devolved ||Scottish_Government|| and ||Government_of_the_United_Kingdom|| agreed for a referendum to be held on ||Scottish_independence|| in 2014. This referendum resulted in the electorate in Scotland ||2014_Scottish_independence_referendum|| for Scotland to remain part of the United Kingdom. In 2016, 51.9 per cent of voters in the United Kingdom ||2016_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum||. The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and completed its withdrawal in full at the end of that year. The ||COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_Kingdom|| had a major impact on the UK in 2020 and 2021. Geography Main article: ||Geography_of_the_United_Kingdom||  The United Kingdom showing hilly regions to north and west The total area of the United Kingdom is approximately 244,820 square kilometres (94,530 sq mi). The country occupies the major part of the ||British_Isles|| archipelago and includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland and some smaller surrounding islands. It lies between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea with the southeast coast coming within 22 miles (35 km) of the coast of northern France, from which it is separated by the ||English_Channel||. In 1993 10 per cent of the UK was forested, 46 per cent used for pastures and 25 per cent cultivated for agriculture. The ||Royal_Observatory,_Greenwich|| in London was chosen as the defining point of the ||Prime_Meridian|| in ||International_Meridian_Conference||, although due to more accurate modern measurement the meridian actually lies 100 metres to the east of the observatory. The United Kingdom lies between latitudes ||49th_parallel_north|| and ||61st_parallel_north||, and longitudes ||9th_meridian_west|| and ||2nd_meridian_east||. Northern Ireland shares a 224-mile (360 km) land boundary with the Republic of Ireland. The coastline of Great Britain is 11,073 miles (17,820 km) long. It is connected to continental Europe by the ||Channel_Tunnel||, which at 31 miles (50 km) (24 miles (38 km) underwater) is the longest underwater tunnel in the world. ||Geography_of_England|| accounts for just over half (53 per cent) of the total area of the UK, covering 130,395 square kilometres (50,350 sq mi). Most of the country consists of lowland terrain, with more upland and some mountainous terrain northwest of the ||Tees-Exe_line||; including the ||Lake_District||, the ||Pennines||, ||Exmoor|| and ||Dartmoor||. The main rivers and estuaries are the ||River_Thames||, ||River_Severn|| and the ||Humber||. England's highest mountain is ||Scafell_Pike|| (978 metres (3,209 ft)) in the ||Lake_District||. The ||Skiddaw||, ||Keswick,_Cumbria|| and ||Derwent_Water|| in the ||Lake_District||||Isle_of_Skye|| is one of the major islands in the ||Inner_Hebrides|| and part of the ||Scottish_Highlands||. ||Geography_of_Scotland|| accounts for just under one-third (32 per cent) of the total area of the UK, covering 78,772 square kilometres (30,410 sq mi). This includes nearly 800 ||List_of_islands_of_Scotland||, predominantly west and north of the mainland; notably the ||Hebrides||, ||Orkney|| and ||Shetland||. Scotland is the most mountainous country in the UK and its topography is distinguished by the ||Highland_Boundary_Fault|| – a ||Fault_(geology)|| – which traverses Scotland from ||Isle_of_Arran|| in the west to ||Stonehaven|| in the east. The ||Fault_(geology)|| separates two distinctively different regions; namely the ||Scottish_Highlands|| to the north and west and the ||Scottish_Lowlands|| to the south and east. The more rugged Highland region contains the majority of Scotland's mountainous land, including ||Ben_Nevis|| which at 1,345 metres (4,413 ft) is the highest point in the British Isles. Lowland areas – especially the narrow waist of land between the ||Firth_of_Clyde|| and the ||Firth_of_Forth|| known as the ||Central_Lowlands|| – are flatter and home to most of the population including ||Glasgow||, Scotland's largest city, and ||Edinburgh||, its capital and political centre, although upland and mountainous terrain lies within the ||Southern_Uplands||. ||Worm%27s_Head|| in the ||Gower_Peninsula||The ||Giant%27s_Causeway|| in ||County_Antrim|| ||Geography_of_Wales|| accounts for less than one-tenth (9 per cent) of the total area of the UK, covering 20,779 square kilometres (8,020 sq mi). Wales is mostly mountainous, though ||South_Wales|| is less mountainous than ||North_Wales|| and ||Mid_Wales||. The main population and industrial areas are in South Wales, consisting of the coastal cities of ||Cardiff||, ||Swansea|| and ||Newport,_Wales||, and the ||South_Wales_Valleys|| to their north. The highest mountains in Wales are in ||Snowdonia|| and include ||Snowdon|| (||Welsh_language||: Yr Wyddfa) which, at 1,085 metres (3,560 ft), is the highest peak in Wales. Wales has over 2,704 kilometres (1,680 miles) of coastline. Several islands lie off the Welsh mainland, the largest of which is ||Anglesey|| (Ynys Môn) in the north-west. ||Geography_of_Ireland||, separated from Great Britain by the ||Irish_Sea|| and ||North_Channel_(Great_Britain_and_Ireland)||, has an area of 14,160 square kilometres (5,470 sq mi) and is mostly hilly. It includes ||Lough_Neagh|| which, at 388 square kilometres (150 sq mi), is the largest lake in the British Isles by area. The highest peak in Northern Ireland is ||Slieve_Donard|| in the ||Mourne_Mountains|| at 852 metres (2,795 ft). The UK contains four terrestrial ecoregions: ||Celtic_broadleaf_forests||, ||English_Lowlands_beech_forests||, ||North_Atlantic_moist_mixed_forests||, and ||Caledon_conifer_forests||. The country had a 2019 ||Forest_Landscape_Integrity_Index|| mean score of 1.65/10, ranking it 161th globally out of 172 countries. Climate Main article: ||Climate_of_the_United_Kingdom||  ||K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification|| of the UK Most of the United Kingdom has a temperate climate, with generally cool temperatures and plentiful rainfall all year round. The temperature varies with the seasons seldom dropping below 0 ||Celsius|| (32 ||Fahrenheit||) or rising above 30 °C (86 °F). Some parts, away from the coast, of upland England, Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland, experience a ||Subpolar_oceanic_climate|| (Cfc). Higher elevations in Scotland experience a ||Subarctic_climate|| (Dfc) and the mountains experience a ||Tundra_climate|| (ET). The prevailing wind is from the southwest and bears frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the Atlantic Ocean, although the eastern parts are mostly sheltered from this wind since the majority of the rain falls over the western regions the eastern parts are therefore the driest. Atlantic currents, warmed by the ||Gulf_Stream||, bring mild winters; especially in the west where winters are wet and even more so over high ground. Summers are warmest in the southeast of England and coolest in the north. Heavy snowfall can occur in winter and early spring on high ground, and occasionally settles to great depth away from the hills. United Kingdom is ranked 4 out of 180 countries in the ||Environmental_Performance_Index||. A law has been passed that ||Greenhouse_gas_emissions_by_the_United_Kingdom|| will be ||Net_zero|| by 2050. Government and politics Main articles: ||Government_of_the_United_Kingdom|| and ||Politics_of_the_United_Kingdom|| ||Elizabeth_II||, monarch since 1952||Boris_Johnson||, prime minister since 2019 The United Kingdom is a ||Unitary_state|| under a ||Constitutional_monarchy||. ||Queen_Elizabeth_II|| is the ||Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom|| and head of state of the UK, as well as 14 other independent countries. These 15 countries are sometimes referred to as "||Commonwealth_realm||". The monarch has "the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn". The ||Constitution_of_the_United_Kingdom|| is ||Uncodified_constitution|| and consists mostly of a collection of disparate written sources, including ||Statute||, judge-made ||Case_law|| and international treaties, together with ||British_Constitution#Conventions||. The ||UK_Parliament|| can carry out constitutional reform by passing ||Act_of_Parliament_(UK)||, and thus has the political power to change or abolish almost any written or unwritten element of the constitution. No sitting parliament can pass laws that future parliaments cannot change.  The ||Palace_of_Westminster||, seat of both houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom  Organisational chart of the UK political system The UK is a ||Parliamentary_system|| ||Democracy|| and a ||Constitutional_monarchy||. The ||Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom|| is ||Parliamentary_sovereignty_in_the_United_Kingdom||. It is made up of the ||House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom||, the ||House_of_Lords|| and ||Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom||. The main business of parliament takes place in the two houses, but ||Royal_assent|| is required for a bill to become an ||Act_of_Parliament_(UK)|| (law). For ||General_elections_in_the_United_Kingdom|| (elections to the House of Commons), the UK is divided into 650 ||United_Kingdom_constituencies||, each of which is represented by a ||Member_of_Parliament_(United_Kingdom)|| (MP). MPs hold office for up to five years and are always up for reelection in general elections. The ||Conservative_Party_(UK)||, ||Labour_Party_(UK)|| and ||Scottish_National_Party|| are, respectively, the current first, second and third largest parties (by number of MPs) in the House of Commons. The ||Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom|| is the ||Head_of_government|| in the United Kingdom. Nearly all prime ministers have served as ||First_Lord_of_the_Treasury|| and all prime ministers have continuously served as First Lord of the Treasury since 1905, ||Minister_for_the_Civil_Service|| since 1968 and ||Minister_for_the_Union|| since 2019. In modern times, the prime minister is, by ||Constitutional_conventions_of_the_United_Kingdom||, an MP. The prime minister is appointed by the monarch and their appointment is governed by constitutional conventions. However, they are normally the leader of the ||Political_Parties_of_the_United_Kingdom|| with the most seats in the House of Commons and hold office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the House of Commons. The prime minister not only has statutory functions (alongside other ministers), but is the monarch's principal adviser and it is for them to advise the monarch on the exercise of the ||Royal_prerogative_in_the_United_Kingdom|| in relation to government. In particular, the prime minister recommends the appointment of ||List_of_government_ministers_of_the_United_Kingdom|| and chairs the ||Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom||. Administrative divisions Main article: ||Administrative_geography_of_the_United_Kingdom|| ||England|| ||Scotland|| ||Wales|| ||Northern_Ireland|| The four ||Countries_of_the_United_Kingdom|| The geographical division of the United Kingdom into ||Counties_of_the_United_Kingdom|| or shires began in England and Scotland in the early Middle Ages and was complete throughout Great Britain and Ireland by the early Modern Period. Administrative arrangements were developed separately in each country of the United Kingdom, with origins which often predated the formation of the United Kingdom. Modern local government by elected councils, partly based on the ancient counties, was introduced separately: in England and Wales in a ||Local_Government_Act_1888||, Scotland in a ||Local_Government_(Scotland)_Act_1889|| and Ireland in a ||Local_Government_(Ireland)_Act_1898||, meaning there is no consistent system of administrative or geographic demarcation across the United Kingdom. Until the 19th century there was little change to those arrangements, but there has since been a constant evolution of role and function. The organisation of ||Local_government_in_England|| is complex, with the distribution of functions varying according to local arrangements. The upper-tier ||Subdivisions_of_England|| are the nine ||Regions_of_England||, now used primarily for statistical purposes. One region, ||Greater_London_Authority||, has had a directly elected assembly and mayor since 2000 following popular support for the proposal in a ||1998_Greater_London_Authority_referendum||. It was intended that other regions would also be given their own elected ||Regional_assembly_(England)||, but a proposed assembly in the ||North_East_England|| region was rejected by a ||2004_Northern_England_devolution_referendums||. Since 2011, ten ||Combined_authority|| have been established in England. Eight of these have ||Directly_elected_mayors_in_England_and_Wales||, the first elections for which took place on 4 May 2017. Below the regional tier, some parts of England have ||Metropolitan_and_non-metropolitan_counties_of_England|| and district councils and others have ||Unitary_authorities||, while London consists of 32 ||London_borough|| and the ||City_of_London||. Councillors are elected by the ||Plurality_voting_system|| system in single-member wards or by the ||Plurality-at-large_voting|| in multi-member wards. For ||Local_government_in_Scotland||, Scotland is divided into ||Subdivisions_of_Scotland||, with wide variation in both size and population. The cities of ||Glasgow||, Edinburgh, ||Aberdeen|| and ||Dundee|| are separate council areas, as is the ||Politics_of_the_Highland_council_area||, which includes a third of Scotland's area but only just over 200,000 people. Local councils are made up of elected councillors, of whom there are 1,223; they are paid a part-time salary. Elections are conducted by ||Single_transferable_vote|| in multi-member wards that elect either three or four councillors. Each council elects a ||Provost_(civil)||, or ||Chairman||, to chair meetings of the council and to act as a figurehead for the area. ||Local_government_in_Wales|| consists of 22 unitary authorities. All unitary authorities are led by a leader and cabinet elected by the council itself. These include the cities of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport, which are unitary authorities in their own right. Elections are held every four years under the first-past-the-post system. ||Local_government_in_Northern_Ireland|| has since 1973 been organised into 26 district councils, each elected by single transferable vote. Their powers are limited to services such as collecting waste, controlling dogs and maintaining parks and cemeteries. In 2008 the executive agreed on proposals to create 11 new councils and replace the present system. Devolved governments Main articles: ||Devolution_in_the_United_Kingdom||, ||List_of_current_heads_of_government_in_the_United_Kingdom_and_dependencies#Countries_of_the_United_Kingdom||, ||Northern_Ireland_Executive||, ||Scottish_Government||, and ||Welsh_Government||  The ||Scottish_Parliament_Building|| in ||Holyrood,_Edinburgh|| is the seat of the ||Scottish_Parliament||. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each have their own ||Executive_(government)||, led by a ||First_minister|| (or, in the case of Northern Ireland, a diarchal ||First_minister_and_deputy_first_minister||), and a ||Devolved|| ||Unicameral|| legislature. England, the largest country of the United Kingdom, has no devolved executive or legislature and is administered and legislated for directly by the UK's government and parliament on all issues. This situation has given rise to the so-called ||West_Lothian_question||, which concerns the fact that members of parliament from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can vote, sometimes decisively, on matters that affect only England. The 2013 ||Commission_on_the_consequences_of_devolution_for_the_House_of_Commons|| on this recommended that laws affecting only England should need support from a majority of English members of parliament. The ||Scottish_Government|| and ||Scottish_Parliament|| have wide-ranging powers over any matter that has not been specifically ||Reserved_and_excepted_matters|| to the UK Parliament, including ||Education_in_Scotland||, ||NHS_Scotland||, ||Scots_law|| and ||Local_government_in_Scotland||. Their power over economic issues is significantly constrained by an act of the UK parliament passed in 2020. In 2012, the UK and Scottish governments signed the ||Edinburgh_Agreement_(2012)|| setting out the terms for a ||2014_Scottish_independence_referendum|| in 2014, which was defeated 55.3 per cent to 44.7 per cent – resulting in Scotland remaining a devolved part of the United Kingdom.  The ||British-Irish_Council|| comprises the UK Government, the ||Government_of_Ireland|| and the governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland The ||Welsh_Government|| and the ||Senedd|| (Welsh Parliament; formerly the National Assembly for Wales) have more limited powers than those devolved to Scotland. The Senedd is able to legislate on any matter not specifically reserved to the UK Parliament through ||Acts_of_Senedd_Cymru||. The ||Northern_Ireland_Executive|| and ||Northern_Ireland_Assembly|| have powers similar to those devolved to Scotland. The Executive is led by a ||Diarchy|| representing ||Designated_Unionist|| and ||Designated_Nationalist|| members of the Assembly. Devolution to Northern Ireland is contingent on participation by the Northern Ireland administration in the ||North-South_Ministerial_Council||, where the Northern Ireland Executive cooperates and develops joint and shared policies with the ||Government_of_Ireland||. The British and Irish governments co-operate on non-devolved matters affecting Northern Ireland through the ||British%E2%80%93Irish_Intergovernmental_Conference||, which assumes the responsibilities of the Northern Ireland administration in the event of its non-operation. The UK does not have a ||Codified_constitution|| and constitutional matters are not among the powers devolved to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Under the doctrine of ||Parliamentary_sovereignty_in_the_United_Kingdom||, the UK Parliament could, in theory, therefore, abolish the Scottish Parliament, Senedd or Northern Ireland Assembly. Indeed, in 1972, the UK Parliament ||Northern_Ireland_(Temporary_Provisions)_Act_1972|| the ||Parliament_of_Northern_Ireland||, setting a precedent relevant to contemporary devolved institutions. In practice, it would be politically difficult for the UK Parliament to abolish devolution to the Scottish Parliament and the Senedd, given the political entrenchment created by referendum decisions. The political constraints placed upon the UK Parliament's power to interfere with devolution in Northern Ireland are even greater than in relation to Scotland and Wales, given that devolution in Northern Ireland rests upon an international agreement with the ||Government_of_Ireland||. The UK Parliament restricts the three devolved parliaments' legislative competence in economic areas through an Act passed in 2020. Dependencies Main articles: ||British_Overseas_Territories||, ||Crown_dependencies||, ||British_Islands||, and ||List_of_current_heads_of_government_in_the_United_Kingdom_and_dependencies#Crown_dependencies||  A view of ||St_Peter_Port||, ||Guernsey|| The United Kingdom has responsibility for 17 territories that do not form part of the United Kingdom itself: 14 British Overseas Territories and three Crown dependencies. The 14 British Overseas Territories are remnants of the British Empire: ||Anguilla||; ||Bermuda||; the ||British_Antarctic_Territory||; the ||British_Indian_Ocean_Territory||; the ||British_Virgin_Islands||; the ||Cayman_Islands||; the ||Falkland_Islands||; ||Gibraltar||; ||Montserrat||; ||Saint_Helena,_Ascension_and_Tristan_da_Cunha||; the ||Turks_and_Caicos_Islands||; the ||Pitcairn_Islands||; ||South_Georgia_and_the_South_Sandwich_Islands||; and ||Akrotiri_and_Dhekelia|| on the island of ||Cyprus||. British claims in Antarctica have limited international recognition. Collectively Britain's overseas territories encompass an approximate land area of 480,000 square nautical miles (640,000 sq mi; 1,600,000 km), with a total population of approximately 250,000. The overseas territories also give the UK the world's fifth largest ||Exclusive_economic_zone_of_the_United_Kingdom|| at 6,805,586 km (2,627,651 sq mi). A 1999 UK government ||White_paper|| stated that: "[The] Overseas Territories are British for as long as they wish to remain British. Britain has willingly granted independence where it has been requested; and we will continue to do so where this is an option." Self-determination is also enshrined in the constitutions of several overseas territories and three have specifically voted to remain under British sovereignty (Bermuda in ||1995_Bermudan_independence_referendum||, Gibraltar in ||2002_Gibraltar_sovereignty_referendum|| and the Falkland Islands in ||2013_Falkland_Islands_sovereignty_referendum||). The Crown dependencies are possessions of ||The_Crown||, as opposed to overseas territories of the UK. They comprise three independently administered jurisdictions: the ||Channel_Island|| of ||Jersey|| and ||Guernsey|| in the English Channel, and the ||Isle_of_Man|| in the Irish Sea. By mutual agreement, the British Government manages the islands' foreign affairs and defence and the UK Parliament has the authority to legislate on their behalf. Internationally, they are regarded as "territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible". The power to pass legislation affecting the islands ultimately rests with their own respective legislative assemblies, with the assent of the Crown (||Her_Majesty%27s_Most_Honourable_Privy_Council|| or, in the case of the Isle of Man, in certain circumstances the Lieutenant-Governor). Since 2005 each Crown dependency has had a ||List_of_current_heads_of_government_in_the_United_Kingdom_and_dependencies#Crown_dependencies|| as its ||Head_of_government||.  Locations of UK dependencies (crown dependencies alphabetised, overseas territories numbered): A ||Isle_of_Man||; B ||Guernsey||; C ||Jersey||; 1 United Kingdom; 2 ||Gibraltar||; 3 ||Akrotiri_and_Dhekelia||; 4 ||Bermuda||; 5 ||Turks_and_Caicos_Islands||; 6 ||British_Virgin_Islands||; 7 ||Anguilla||; 8 ||Cayman_Islands||; 9 ||Montserrat||; 10 ||Pitcairn_Islands||; 11 ||Saint_Helena,_Ascension_and_Tristan_da_Cunha||; 12 ||British_Indian_Ocean_Territory||; 13 ||Falkland_Islands||; 14 ||South_Georgia_and_the_South_Sandwich_Islands||; (15) ||British_Antarctic_Territory|| Law and criminal justice Main article: ||Law_of_the_United_Kingdom||  The ||Royal_Courts_of_Justice|| of ||England_and_Wales|| The United Kingdom does not have a single legal system as Article 19 of the ||Treaty_of_Union|| provided for the continuation of Scotland's separate legal system. Today the UK has three distinct ||Legal_systems_of_the_world||: ||English_law||, ||Courts_of_Northern_Ireland|| and ||Scots_law||. A new ||Supreme_Court_of_the_United_Kingdom|| came into being in October 2009 to replace the ||Judicial_functions_of_the_House_of_Lords||. The ||Judicial_Committee_of_the_Privy_Council||, including the same members as the Supreme Court, is the highest court of appeal for several independent Commonwealth countries, the ||British_Overseas_Territories|| and the ||Crown_Dependencies||.  The ||High_Court_of_Justiciary|| – the ||College_of_Justice|| ||Criminal_justice|| of ||Scotland|| Both English law, which applies in ||England_and_Wales||, and ||Northern_Ireland_law|| are based on ||Common_law|| principles. The essence of common law is that, subject to statute, the law is developed by judges in courts, applying statute, ||Precedent|| and common sense to the facts before them to give explanatory judgements of the relevant legal principles, which are reported and binding in future similar cases (||Stare_decisis||). The ||Courts_of_England_and_Wales|| are headed by the ||Senior_Courts_of_England_and_Wales||, consisting of the ||Court_of_Appeal_of_England_and_Wales||, the ||High_Court_of_Justice|| (for civil cases) and the ||Crown_Court|| (for criminal cases). The Supreme Court is the highest court in the land for both criminal and civil appeal cases in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and any decision it makes is binding on every other court in the same jurisdiction, often having a persuasive effect in other jurisdictions. Scots law is a hybrid system based on both common-law and ||Civil_law_(legal_system)|| principles. The chief courts are the ||Court_of_Session||, for civil cases, and the ||High_Court_of_Justiciary||, for criminal cases. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom serves as the highest court of appeal for civil cases under Scots law. ||Sheriff_Court|| deal with most civil and criminal cases including conducting criminal trials with a jury, known as sheriff solemn court, or with a sheriff and no jury, known as sheriff summary Court. The Scots legal system is unique in having three possible ||Verdict|| for a criminal trial: "||Guilt_(law)||", "||Acquittal||" and "||Not_proven||". Both "not guilty" and "not proven" result in an acquittal. Crime in England and Wales increased in the period between 1981 and 1995, though since that peak there has been an overall fall of 66 per cent in recorded crime from 1995 to 2015, according to ||Crime_statistics_in_the_United_Kingdom||. The ||Prison_population_of_England_and_Wales|| has increased to 86,000, giving England and Wales the highest rate of incarceration in Western Europe at 148 per 100,000. ||Her_Majesty%27s_Prison_Service||, which reports to the ||Ministry_of_Justice_(United_Kingdom)||, manages most of the prisons within England and Wales. The murder rate in England and Wales has stabilised in the first half of the 2010s with a murder rate around 1 per 100,000 which is half the peak in 2002 and similar to the rate in the 1980s Crime in Scotland fell slightly in 2014–2015 to its lowest level in 39 years in with 59 killings for a murder rate of 1.1 per 100,000. Scotland's prisons are overcrowded but the prison population is shrinking. Foreign relations Main article: ||Foreign_relations_of_the_United_Kingdom|| The UK is a ||Big_Five_(United_Nations)|| of the ||United_Nations_Security_Council||, a member of ||NATO||, ||AUKUS||, the ||Commonwealth_of_Nations||, the ||G7_finance_ministers||, the ||G7_forum||, the ||G-20_major_economies||, the ||Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development||, the ||World_Trade_Organization||, the ||Council_of_Europe|| and the ||Organization_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe||. The UK is said to have a "||Special_Relationship||" with the ||United_States|| and a close partnership with France – the "||Entente_cordiale||" – and shares nuclear weapons technology with both countries; the ||Anglo-Portuguese_Alliance|| is considered to be the oldest binding military alliance in the world. The UK is also closely linked with the Republic of Ireland; the two countries share a ||Common_Travel_Area|| and co-operate through the ||British-Irish_Intergovernmental_Conference|| and the ||British-Irish_Council||. Britain's global presence and influence is further amplified through its trading relations, foreign investments, ||Official_development_assistance|| and military engagements. Canada, Australia and New Zealand, all of which are former colonies of the British Empire which share Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state, are the most favourably viewed countries in the world by ||British_people||. Military Main article: ||British_Armed_Forces||  ||HMS_Queen_Elizabeth_(R08)|| and ||HMS_Prince_of_Wales_(R09)||, a pair of ||Queen_Elizabeth-class_aircraft_carrier|| of the ||Royal_Navy||. ||British_Armed_Forces|| consist of three professional service branches: the ||Royal_Navy|| and ||Royal_Marines|| (forming the ||Naval_Service_(United_Kingdom)||), the ||British_Army|| and the ||Royal_Air_Force||. The armed forces of the United Kingdom are managed by the ||Ministry_of_Defence_(United_Kingdom)|| and controlled by the ||Defence_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom||, chaired by the ||Secretary_of_State_for_Defence||. The ||Commander-in-Chief|| is the ||Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom||, to whom members of the forces swear an oath of allegiance. The Armed Forces are charged with protecting the UK and its overseas territories, promoting the UK's global security interests and supporting international peacekeeping efforts. They are active and regular participants in ||NATO||, including the ||Allied_Rapid_Reaction_Corps||, the ||Five_Power_Defence_Arrangements||, ||RIMPAC|| and other worldwide coalition operations. ||Overseas_military_bases_of_the_United_Kingdom|| and facilities are maintained in ||RAF_Ascension_Island||, ||Mina_Salman||, ||Military_of_Belize||, ||Military_Forces_based_in_Brunei||, ||British_Army_Training_Unit_Suffield||, ||British_Forces_Cyprus||, ||Diego_Garcia||, the ||Military_of_the_Falkland_Islands||, ||British_Forces_Germany||, ||British_Forces_Gibraltar||, ||British_Army_Training_Unit_Kenya||, ||Oman||, ||Al_Udeid_Air_Base|| and ||Singapore||. The British armed forces played a key role in establishing the ||British_Empire|| as the ||Superpower|| in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries. By emerging victorious from conflicts, Britain has often been able to decisively ||International_relations_of_the_Great_Powers_(1814%E2%80%931919)||. Since the end of the British Empire, the UK has remained a major military power. Following the end of the ||Cold_War||, defence policy has a stated assumption that "the most demanding operations" will be undertaken as part of a coalition. According to sources which include the ||Stockholm_International_Peace_Research_Institute|| and the ||International_Institute_for_Strategic_Studies||, the UK has either the fourth- or the fifth-highest ||List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures||. Total defence spending amounts to 2.0 per cent of national GDP. Economy Main article: ||Economy_of_the_United_Kingdom|| Overview  The ||Bank_of_England|| – the ||Central_bank|| of the United Kingdom and the model on which most modern central banks have been based The UK has a partially regulated ||Market_economy||. Based on market ||Exchange_rate||, the UK is today the fifth-largest economy in the world and the second-largest in Europe after ||Germany||. ||HM_Treasury||, led by the ||Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer||, is responsible for developing and executing the government's ||Public_finance|| policy and ||Economic_policy||. The ||Bank_of_England|| is the UK's ||Central_bank|| and is responsible for issuing notes and coins in the nation's currency, the ||Pound_sterling||. Banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland retain the right to issue their own notes, subject to retaining enough Bank of England notes in reserve to cover their issue. The pound sterling is the world's fourth-largest ||Reserve_currency|| (after the US dollar, euro, and Japanese Yen). Since 1997 the Bank of England's ||Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)||, headed by the ||Governor_of_the_Bank_of_England||, has been responsible for setting ||Official_bank_rate|| at the level necessary to achieve the overall inflation target for the economy that is set by the Chancellor each year. The UK ||Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy|| makes up around 79 per cent of ||Gross_domestic_product||. ||London|| is one of the world's largest financial centres, ranking 2nd in the world, behind ||New_York_City||, in the ||Global_Financial_Centres_Index|| in 2020. London also has the ||List_of_cities_by_GDP|| in Europe. Edinburgh ranks 17th in the world, and 6th in Western Europe in the Global Financial Centres Index in 2020. ||Tourism_in_the_United_Kingdom|| is very important to the British economy; with over 27 million tourists arriving in 2004, the United Kingdom is ranked as the sixth major tourist destination in the world and London has the most international visitors of any city in the world. The ||Creative_industries|| accounted for 7 per cent GVA in 2005 and grew at an average of 6 per cent per annum between 1997 and 2005. Following the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, the functioning of the UK internal economic market is enshrined by the ||United_Kingdom_Internal_Market_Act_2020|| which ensures trade in goods and services continues without internal barriers across the four countries of the United Kingdom. The ||Industrial_Revolution|| started in the UK with an initial concentration on the textile industry, followed by other heavy industries such as ||Shipbuilding||, coal mining and ||Steelmaking||. British merchants, shippers and bankers developed overwhelming advantage over those of other nations allowing the UK to dominate international trade in the 19th century. As other nations industrialised, coupled with economic decline after two world wars, the United Kingdom began to lose its competitive advantage and heavy industry declined, by degrees, throughout the 20th century. Manufacturing remains a significant part of the economy but accounted for only 16.7 per cent of national output in 2003.  The ||Mini_Electric|| is manufactured in the UK The ||Automotive_industry_in_the_United_Kingdom|| employs around 800,000 people, with a turnover in 2015 of £70 billion, generating £34.6 billion of exports (11.8 per cent of the UK's total export goods). In 2015, the UK produced around 1.6 million passenger vehicles and 94,500 commercial vehicles. The UK is a major centre for engine manufacturing: in 2015 around 2.4 million engines were produced. The UK ||Auto_racing|| industry employs around 41,000 people, comprises around 4,500 companies and has an annual turnover of around £6 billion. The ||Aerospace_industry_in_the_United_Kingdom|| is the second- or third-largest national aerospace industry in the world depending upon the method of measurement and has an annual turnover of around £30 billion.  Engines and wings for the ||Airbus_A380|| are manufactured in the UK. ||BAE_Systems|| plays a critical role in some of the world's biggest defence aerospace projects. In the UK, the company makes large sections of the ||Typhoon_Eurofighter|| and assembles the aircraft for the ||Royal_Air_Force||. It is also a principal subcontractor on the ||Lockheed_Martin_F-35_Lightning_II|| Joint Strike Fighter – the world's largest single defence project – for which it designs and manufactures a range of components. It also manufactures the ||BAE_Hawk||, the world's most successful jet training aircraft. ||Airbus_UK|| also manufactures the wings for the ||Airbus_A400M_Atlas|| military transporter. Rolls-Royce is the world's second-largest aero-engine manufacturer. Its engines power more than 30 types of ||Commercial_aircraft|| and it has more than 30,000 engines in service in the civil and defence sectors. The UK space industry was worth £9.1bn in 2011 and employed 29,000 people. It is growing at a rate of 7.5 per cent annually, according to its umbrella organisation, the ||UK_Space_Agency||. In 2013, the British Government pledged £60 m to the ||Skylon_(spacecraft)|| project: this investment will provide support at a "crucial stage" to allow a full-scale prototype of the ||SABRE_(rocket_engine)|| engine to be built. The ||Pharmaceutical_industry_in_the_United_Kingdom|| plays an important role in the UK economy and the country has the third-highest share of global pharmaceutical R&D expenditures. Agriculture is intensive, highly mechanised and efficient by European standards, producing about 60 per cent of food needs with less than 1.6 per cent of the labour force (535,000 workers). Around two-thirds of production is devoted to livestock, one-third to arable crops. The UK retains a significant, though much reduced fishing industry. It is also rich in a number of natural resources including coal, petroleum, natural gas, tin, limestone, iron ore, salt, clay, chalk, gypsum, lead, silica and an abundance of arable land. The ||City_of_London|| is one of two main ||International_financial_centre||||Canary_Wharf|| is one of two main financial centres of the United Kingdom In 2020, coronavirus lockdown measures caused the UK economy to suffer its biggest slump on record, shrinking by 20.4 per cent between April and June compared to the first three months of the year, to push it officially into recession for the first time in 11 years. ||List_of_countries_by_external_debt|| of $9.6 ||Trillion_(short_scale)|| dollars, which is the second-highest in the world after the US. As a percentage of GDP, external debt is 408 per cent, which is the third-highest in the world after Luxembourg and Iceland. Science and technology Main article: ||Science_and_technology_in_the_United_Kingdom||  ||Stephen_Hawking|| (1942–2018) advanced theories in ||Cosmology||, ||Quantum_gravity|| and ||Black_holes||. England and Scotland were leading centres of the ||Scientific_Revolution|| from the 17th century. The United Kingdom led the Industrial Revolution from the 18th century, and has continued to produce scientists and engineers credited with important advances. Major theorists from the 17th and 18th centuries include ||Isaac_Newton||, whose ||Newton%27s_laws_of_motion|| and illumination of ||Gravitation|| have been seen as a keystone of modern science; from the 19th century ||Charles_Darwin||, whose theory of ||Evolution|| by ||Natural_selection|| was fundamental to the development of modern biology, and ||James_Clerk_Maxwell||, who formulated classical ||Electromagnetic_theory||; and more recently ||Stephen_Hawking||, who advanced major theories in the fields of ||Cosmology||, ||Quantum_gravity|| and the investigation of ||Black_holes||.  A ||Watt_steam_engine||, which was fundamental in driving the ||Industrial_Revolution|| Major scientific discoveries from the 18th century include ||Hydrogen|| by ||Henry_Cavendish||; from the 20th century ||Penicillin|| by ||Alexander_Fleming||, and the structure of ||DNA||, by ||Francis_Crick|| and others. Famous British engineers and inventors of the Industrial Revolution include ||James_Watt||, ||George_Stephenson||, ||Richard_Arkwright||, ||Robert_Stephenson|| and ||Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel||. Other major engineering projects and applications by people from the UK include the ||Steam_locomotive||, developed by ||Richard_Trevithick|| and ||Andrew_Vivian||; from the 19th century the ||Electric_motor|| by ||Michael_Faraday||, the ||Analytical_engine|| designed by ||Charles_Babbage||, the first commercial ||Electrical_telegraph|| by ||William_Fothergill_Cooke|| and ||Charles_Wheatstone||, the ||Incandescent_light_bulb|| by ||Joseph_Swan||, and the first practical telephone, patented by ||Alexander_Graham_Bell||; and in the 20th century the world's first working television system by ||John_Logie_Baird|| and others, the ||Jet_engine|| by ||Frank_Whittle||, the basis of the ||Modern_computer|| by ||Alan_Turing||, and the ||World_Wide_Web|| by ||Tim_Berners-Lee||. Scientific research and development remains important in British universities, with many establishing ||Science_park|| to facilitate production and co-operation with industry. Between 2004 and 2008 the UK produced 7 per cent of the world's scientific research papers and had an 8 per cent share of scientific citations, the third and second-highest in the world (after the United States and China, respectively). Scientific journals produced in the UK include ||Nature_(journal)||, the ||BMJ|| and ||The_Lancet||. The United Kingdom was ranked 4th in the ||Global_Innovation_Index|| 2020 and 2021, up from 5th in 2019. Transport Main article: ||Transport_in_the_United_Kingdom||  ||St_Pancras_railway_station|| is one of London's main domestic and international transport hubs, providing commuter and high-speed rail services across the UK and to Paris, ||Lille|| and ||Brussels||. A radial road network totals 29,145 miles (46,904 km) of main roads, 2,173 miles (3,497 km) of motorways and 213,750 miles (344,000 km) of paved roads. The ||M25_motorway||, encircling London, is the largest and busiest bypass in the world. In 2009 there were a total of 34 million licensed vehicles in Great Britain. The rail network in the UK is the oldest such network in the world. The system consists of five high-speed main lines (the ||West_Coast_Main_Line||, ||East_Coast_Main_Line||, ||Midland_Main_Line||, ||Great_Western_Main_Line|| and ||Great_Eastern_Main_Line||), which radiate from London to the rest of the country, augmented by regional rail lines and dense commuter networks within the major cities. ||High_Speed_1|| is operationally separate from the rest of the network. The world's first passenger railway running on steam was the ||Stockton_and_Darlington_Railway||, opened in 1825. Just under five years later the world's first intercity railway was the ||Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railway||, designed by ||George_Stephenson||. The network grew rapidly as a patchwork of hundreds of separate companies during the ||Victorian_era||. The UK has a railway network of 10,072 miles (16,209 km) in ||Rail_transport_in_Great_Britain|| and 189 miles (304 km) in ||Northern_Ireland_Railways||. Railways in Northern Ireland are operated by ||NI_Railways||, a subsidiary of state-owned ||Translink_(Northern_Ireland)||. In Great Britain, the ||British_Rail|| network was ||Privatisation_of_British_Rail|| between 1994 and 1997, which was followed by a rapid rise in passenger numbers. The UK was ranked eighth among national European rail systems in the 2017 European Railway Performance Index assessing intensity of use, quality of service and safety. ||Network_Rail|| owns and manages most of the fixed assets (tracks, signals etc.). ||HS2||, a new high-speed railway line, is estimated to cost £56 billion. ||Crossrail||, under construction in London, is Europe's largest construction project with a £15 billion projected cost. In the year from October 2009 to September 2010 UK airports handled a total of 211.4 million passengers. In that period the three largest airports were ||London_Heathrow_Airport|| (65.6 million passengers), ||Gatwick_Airport|| (31.5 million passengers) and ||London_Stansted_Airport|| (18.9 million passengers). London Heathrow Airport, located 15 miles (24 km) west of the capital, has the most international passenger traffic of any airport in the world and is the hub for the UK flag carrier ||British_Airways||, as well as ||Virgin_Atlantic||.  Energy mix of the United Kingdom over time Energy Main article: ||Energy_in_the_United_Kingdom||  Wind turbines overlooking Ardrossan, Scotland. The UK is ||Wind_power_in_the_United_Kingdom||, and wind power production is its fastest-growing supply. In 2006, the UK was the world's ninth-largest consumer of energy and the 15th-largest producer. The UK is home to a number of large energy companies, including two of the six oil and gas "||Supermajor||" – ||BP|| and ||Shell_plc||. In 2013, the UK produced 914 thousand barrels per day (bbl/d) of oil and consumed 1,507 thousand bbl/d. Production is now in decline and the UK has been a net importer of oil since 2005. In 2010 the UK had around 3.1 billion barrels of proven ||North_Sea_oil||, the largest of any EU member state. In 2009, the UK was the 13th-largest producer of natural gas in the world and the largest producer in the EU. Production is now in decline and the UK has been a net importer of natural gas since 2004. Coal production played a key role in the UK economy in the 19th and 20th centuries. In the mid-1970s, 130 million tonnes of coal were produced annually, not falling below 100 million tonnes until the early 1980s. During the 1980s and 1990s the industry was scaled back considerably. In 2011, the UK produced 18.3 million tonnes of coal. In 2005 it had proven recoverable coal reserves of 171 million tons. The UK ||Coal_Authority|| has stated there is a potential to produce between 7 billion tonnes and 16 billion tonnes of coal through ||Underground_coal_gasification|| or '||Hydraulic_fracturing||, and that, based on current UK coal consumption, such reserves could last between 200 and 400 years. Environmental and social concerns have been raised over chemicals getting into the water table and minor earthquakes damaging homes. In the late 1990s, nuclear power plants contributed around 25 per cent of total annual electricity generation in the UK, but this has gradually declined as old plants have been shut down and ageing-related problems affect plant availability. In 2012, the UK had 16 reactors normally generating about 19 per cent of its electricity. All but one of the reactors will be retired by 2023. Unlike Germany and Japan, the UK intends to build a new generation of nuclear plants from about 2018. The total of all renewable electricity sources provided for 38.9 per cent of the electricity generated in the United Kingdom in the third quarter of 2019, producing 28.8TWh of electricity. The UK is ||Wind_power_in_the_United_Kingdom||, and wind power production is its fastest-growing supply, in 2019 it generated almost 20 per cent of the UK's total electricity. Water supply and sanitation Main article: ||Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_the_United_Kingdom|| Access to improved water supply and sanitation in the UK is universal. It is estimated that 96.7 per cent of households are connected to the sewer network. According to the Environment Agency, total water abstraction for public water supply in the UK was 16,406 ||Megalitre|| per day in 2007. In England and Wales water and sewerage services are provided by 10 private regional water and sewerage companies and 13 mostly smaller private "water only" companies. In Scotland, water and sewerage services are provided by a single public company, ||Scottish_Water||. In Northern Ireland water and sewerage services are also provided by a single public entity, ||Northern_Ireland_Water||. Demographics Main article: ||Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom||  Map of population density in the UK as at the 2011 census A ||Census_in_the_United_Kingdom|| is taken simultaneously in all parts of the UK every 10 years. In the ||United_Kingdom_Census_2011|| the total population of the United Kingdom was 63,181,775. It is the fourth-largest in Europe (after Russia, Germany and France), the fifth-largest in the Commonwealth and the 22nd-largest in the world. In mid-2014 and mid-2015 net long-term international migration contributed more to population growth. In mid-2012 and mid-2013 natural change contributed the most to population growth. Between 2001 and 2011 the population increased by an average annual rate of approximately 0.7 per cent. This compares to 0.3 per cent per year in the period 1991 to 2001 and 0.2 per cent in the decade 1981 to 1991. The 2011 census also showed that, over the previous 100 years, the proportion of the population aged 0–14 fell from 31 per cent to 18 per cent, and the proportion of people aged 65 and over rose from 5 to 16 per cent. In 2018 the ||Median_age|| of the UK population was 41.7 years. England's population in 2011 was 53 million, representing some 84 per cent of the UK total. It is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, with 420 people resident per square kilometre in mid-2015, with a particular concentration in London and the south-east. The 2011 census put Scotland's population at 5.3 million, Wales at 3.06 million and Northern Ireland at 1.81 million. In 2017 the average ||Total_fertility_rate|| (TFR) across the UK was 1.74 children born per woman. While a rising birth rate is contributing to population growth, it remains considerably below the ||Baby_boom|| peak of 2.95 children per woman in 1964, or the high of 6.02 children born per woman in 1815, below the replacement rate of 2.1, but higher than the 2001 record low of 1.63. In 2011, 47.3 per cent of births in the UK were to unmarried women. The ||Office_for_National_Statistics|| published a bulletin in 2015 showing that, out of the UK population aged 16 and over, 1.7 per cent identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual (2.0 per cent of males and 1.5 per cent of females); 4.5 per cent of respondents responded with "other", "I don't know", or did not respond. The number of ||LGBT_rights_in_the_United_Kingdom|| was estimated to be between 65,000 and 300,000 by research between 2001 and 2008.   Largest urban areas of the United Kingdom(England and Wales: 2011 census built-up area; Scotland: 2016 estimates settlement; Northern Ireland: 2001 census urban area) ||List_of_urban_areas_in_the_United_Kingdom|| ||List_of_urban_areas_in_the_United_Kingdom|| ||List_of_urban_areas_in_the_United_Kingdom|| ||List_of_urban_areas_in_the_United_Kingdom|| ||List_of_urban_areas_in_the_United_Kingdom|| ||List_of_urban_areas_in_the_United_Kingdom|| ||List_of_urban_areas_in_the_United_Kingdom|| ||List_of_urban_areas_in_the_United_Kingdom|| ||Greater_London_Urban_Area|| ||Greater_Manchester_Urban_Area|| 1 ||Greater_London_Urban_Area|| 9,787,426 ||London|| 11 ||Bristol_Urban_Area|| 617,280 ||Bristol|| ||West_Midlands_Urban_Area|| ||West_Yorkshire_Urban_Area|| 2 ||Greater_Manchester_Urban_Area|| 2,553,379 ||Manchester|| 12 ||Edinburgh|| 512,150 ||Edinburgh|| 3 ||West_Midlands_Urban_Area|| 2,440,986 ||Birmingham|| 13 ||Leicester_Urban_Area|| 508,916 ||Leicester|| 4 ||West_Yorkshire_Urban_Area|| 1,777,934 ||Leeds|| 14 ||Belfast|| 483,418 ||Belfast|| 5 ||Greater_Glasgow|| 985,290 ||Glasgow|| 15 ||Brighton_and_Hove_built-up_area|| 474,485 ||Brighton|| 6 ||Liverpool_Urban_Area|| 864,122 ||Liverpool|| 16 ||South_East_Dorset_conurbation|| 466,266 ||Bournemouth|| 7 ||South_Hampshire|| 855,569 ||Southampton|| 17 ||Cardiff_Urban_Area|| 390,214 ||Cardiff|| 8 ||Tyneside|| 774,891 ||Newcastle_upon_Tyne|| 18 ||Teesside|| 376,633 ||Middlesbrough|| 9 ||Nottingham_Urban_Area|| 729,977 ||Nottingham|| 19 ||The_Potteries_Urban_Area|| 372,775 ||Stoke-on-Trent|| 10 ||Sheffield_Urban_Area|| 685,368 ||Sheffield|| 20 ||Coventry_and_Bedworth_Urban_Area|| 359,262 ||Coventry|| Ethnic groups Main article: ||Ethnic_groups_in_the_United_Kingdom||  Percentage of the population not white according to the 2011 census Historically, indigenous British people were thought to be ||Genetic_history_of_the_British_Isles|| that settled there before the 12th century: the ||Celts||, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Norse and the ||Normans||. ||Welsh_people|| could be the oldest ethnic group in the UK. A 2006 genetic study shows that more than 50 per cent of England's gene pool contains ||Germanic_peoples|| Y chromosomes. Another 2005 genetic analysis indicates that "about 75 per cent of the traceable ancestors of the modern British population had arrived in the British isles by about 6,200 years ago, at the start of the British Neolithic or Stone Age", and that the British broadly share a common ancestry with the ||Basque_people||. The UK has a history of non-white immigration with ||Liverpool|| having the oldest Black population in the country dating back to at least the 1730s during the period of the African slave trade. During this period it is estimated the Afro-Caribbean population of Great Britain was 10,000 to 15,000 which later declined due to the abolition of slavery. The UK also has the oldest ||British_Chinese|| community in Europe, dating to the arrival of Chinese seamen in the 19th century. In 1950 there were probably fewer than 20,000 non-white residents in Britain, almost all born overseas. In 1951 there were an estimated 94,500 people living in Britain who had been born in South Asia, China, Africa and the Caribbean, just under 0.2 per cent of the UK population. By 1961 this number had more than quadrupled to 384,000, just over 0.7 per cent of the United Kingdom population. Since 1948 substantial immigration from Africa, the ||Caribbean|| and South Asia has been a legacy of ties forged by the ||British_Empire||. Migration from new EU member states in ||Central_Europe|| and Eastern Europe since 2004 has resulted in growth in these population groups, although some of this migration has been temporary. Since the 1990s, there has been substantial diversification of the immigrant population, with migrants to the UK coming from a much wider range of countries than previous waves, which tended to involve larger numbers of migrants coming from a relatively small number of countries. Academics have argued that the ||Classification_of_ethnicity_in_the_United_Kingdom|| employed in British national statistics, which were first introduced in the ||1991_UK_census||, involve confusion between the concepts of ||Ethnicity|| and ||Race_(human_classification)||. In ||United_Kingdom_Census_2011||, 87.2 per cent of the UK population identified themselves as white, meaning 12.8 per cent of the UK population identify themselves as of one of number of ||Minority_group|| groups. In the 2001 census, this figure was 7.9 per cent of the UK population. Because of differences in the wording of the census forms used in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, data on the ||Other_White|| group is not available for the UK as a whole, but in England and Wales this was the fastest-growing group between the 2001 and 2011 censuses, increasing by 1.1 million (1.8 percentage points). Amongst groups for which comparable data is available for all parts of the UK level, the Other Asian category increased from 0.4 per cent to 1.4 per cent of the population between 2001 and 2011, while the ||Mixed_(United_Kingdom_ethnicity_category)|| category rose from 1.2 per cent to 2 per cent.

In 2016, 31.4 per cent of primary and 27.9 per cent of secondary pupils at ||State_school|| in England were members of an ethnic minority. The 1991 census was the first UK census to have a question on ||Ethnic_group||. In the 1991 UK census 94.1 per cent of people reported themselves as being White British, White Irish or White Other with 5.9 per cent of people reporting themselves as coming from other minority groups. Languages Main article: ||Languages_of_the_United_Kingdom|| The UK's de facto official language is English. It is estimated that 95 per cent of the UK's population are ||Monolingual|| English speakers. 5.5 per cent of the population are estimated to speak languages brought to the UK as a result of relatively recent immigration. South Asian languages are the largest grouping which includes ||Punjabi_language||, ||Urdu||, ||Bengali_language||, ||Sylheti_language||, ||Hindi|| and ||Gujarati_language||. According to the 2011 census, ||Polish_language|| has become the second-largest language spoken in England and has 546,000 speakers. In 2019, some three quarters of a million people spoke little or no English. Three indigenous ||Celtic_languages|| are spoken in the UK: ||Welsh_language||, ||Irish_language|| and ||Scottish_Gaelic||. ||Cornish_language||, which became extinct as a first language in the late 18th century, is subject to revival efforts and has a small group of second language speakers. In the 2011 Census, approximately one-fifth (19 per cent) of the population of Wales said they could speak Welsh, an increase from the 1991 Census (18 per cent). In addition, it is estimated that about 200,000 Welsh speakers live in England. In the same census in Northern Ireland 167,487 people (10.4 per cent) stated that they had "some knowledge of Irish" (see ||Irish_language_in_Northern_Ireland||), almost exclusively in the ||Irish_nationalism|| (mainly Catholic) population. Over 92,000 people in Scotland (just under 2 per cent of the population) had some Gaelic language ability, including 72 per cent of those living in the ||Outer_Hebrides||. The number of children being taught either Welsh or Scottish Gaelic is increasing. Among emigrant-descended populations some Scottish Gaelic is still ||Canadian_Gaelic|| (principally ||Nova_Scotia|| and ||Cape_Breton_Island||), and Welsh in ||Patagonia||, Argentina. ||Scots_language||, a language descended from early northern ||Middle_English||, has limited ||European_Charter_for_Regional_or_Minority_Languages|| alongside its regional variant, ||Ulster_Scots_dialects|| in Northern Ireland, without specific commitments to protection and promotion. As of April 2020, there are said to be around 151,000 users of ||British_Sign_Language|| (BSL), a ||Sign_language|| used by deaf people, in the UK. It is compulsory for pupils to study a second language up to the age of 14 in England. French and German are the two most commonly taught second languages in England and Scotland. All pupils in Wales are either taught Welsh as a second language up to age 16, or are ||Welsh_medium_education|| as a ||First_language||. Religion Main article: ||Religion_in_the_United_Kingdom||  ||Westminster_Abbey|| Forms of Christianity have dominated religious life in what is now the United Kingdom for over 1,400 years. Although a majority of citizens still identify with Christianity in many surveys, regular church attendance has fallen dramatically since the middle of the 20th century, while immigration and demographic change have contributed to the growth of other faiths, most notably Islam. This has led some commentators to variously describe the UK as a multi-faith, ||Secularism||, or ||Post-Christian|| society. In the 2001 census 71.6 per cent of all respondents indicated that they were Christians, with the next largest faiths being ||Islam|| (2.8 per cent), ||Hinduism|| (1.0 per cent), ||Sikhism|| (0.6 per cent), ||Judaism|| (0.5 per cent), ||Buddhism|| (0.3 per cent) and all other religions (0.3 per cent). 15 per cent of respondents stated that they had ||Irreligion||, with a further 7 per cent not stating a religious preference. A ||Tearfund|| survey in 2007 showed only one in 10 Britons actually attend church weekly. Between the 2001 and 2011 census there was a decrease in the number of people who identified as Christian by 12 per cent, whilst the percentage of those reporting no religious affiliation doubled. This contrasted with growth in the other main religious group categories, with the number of Muslims increasing by the most substantial margin to a total of about 5 per cent. The ||Islam_in_the_United_Kingdom|| has increased from 1.6 million in 2001 to 2.7 million in 2011, making it the second-largest religious group in the United Kingdom. In a 2016 survey conducted by ||British_Social_Attitudes|| on religious affiliation; 53 per cent of respondents indicated '||Irreligious||, while 41 per cent indicated they were Christians, followed by 6 per cent who affiliated with other religions (e.g. ||Islam||, ||Hinduism||, ||Judaism||, etc.). Among Christians, adherents to the ||Church_of_England|| constituted 15 per cent, ||Catholic_Church|| 9 per cent, and other Christians (including ||Presbyterians||, ||Methodists||, other ||Protestants||, as well as ||Eastern_Orthodox||), 17 per cent. 71 per cent of young people aged 18––24 said they had no religion. The ||Church_of_England|| is the ||State_religion|| in England. It retains a ||Lords_Spiritual|| in the ||Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom|| and the ||Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom|| is its ||Supreme_Governor_of_the_Church_of_England||. In ||Religion_in_Scotland||, the ||Church_of_Scotland|| is recognised as the ||National_church||. It is not ||State_religion||, and the British monarch is an ordinary member, required to swear an oath to "maintain and preserve the ||Protestantism|| and ||Presbyterian_polity||" upon his or her accession. The ||Church_in_Wales|| was disestablished in 1920 and, as the ||Church_of_Ireland|| was disestablished in 1870 before the ||Partition_of_Ireland||, there is no established church in Northern Ireland. Although there are no UK-wide data in the 2001 census on adherence to individual Christian denominations, it has been estimated that 62 per cent of Christians are Anglican, 13.5 per cent ||Catholic_Church||, 6 per cent ||Presbyterian||, and 3.4 per cent ||Methodist||, with small numbers of other Protestant denominations such as ||Plymouth_Brethren||, and ||Eastern_Orthodox_Church|| churches. Migration Main article: ||Modern_immigration_to_the_United_Kingdom|| See also: ||Foreign-born_population_of_the_United_Kingdom||  Estimated foreign-born population by country of birth from April 2007 to March 2008 Year Foreign born population of England and Wales Total population Irish born population Percentage of total population that was born abroad 1851 100,000 17,900,000 520,000 0.6 1861 150,000 20,100,000 600,000 0.7 1871 200,000 22,700,000 565,000 0.9 1881 275,000 26,000,000 560,000 1.1 1891 350,000 29,000,000 460,000 1.2 1901 475,000 32,500,000 425,000 1.5 1911 900,000 32,500,000 375,000 2.5 1921 750,000 37,900,000 365,000 2 1931 1,080,000 40,000,000 380,000 2.7 1951 1,875,000 43,700,000 470,000 4.3 1961 2,290,000 46,000,000 645,000 5.0 1971 3,100,000 48,700,000 585,000 6.4 1981 3,220,000 48,500,000 580,000 6.6 1991 3,625,000 49,900,000 570,000 7.3 2001 4,600,000 52,500,000 475,000 8.8 2011 7,500,000 56,000,000 400,000 13.4 The United Kingdom has experienced successive waves of migration. The ||Great_Famine_(Ireland)|| in Ireland, then part of the United Kingdom, resulted in perhaps a million people migrating to Great Britain. Throughout the 19th century a small population of 28,644 German immigrants built up in England and Wales. London held around half of this population, and other small communities existed in Manchester, Bradford and elsewhere. The ||Germans_in_the_United_Kingdom|| immigrant community was the largest group until 1891, when it became second to ||History_of_the_Jews_in_Russia||. After 1881, Russian Jews suffered bitter persecutions and 2,000,000 left the ||Russian_Empire|| by 1914. Around 120,000 settled permanently in Britain, becoming the largest ethnic minority from outside the British Isles; this population had increased to 370,000 by 1938. Unable to return to Poland at the end of ||World_War_II||, over 120,000 ||Polish_Armed_Forces_in_the_West|| remained in the UK permanently. After the Second World War, many people immigrated from colonies and former-colonies in the ||Caribbean|| and ||Indian_subcontinent||, as a legacy of empire or driven by labour shortages. In 1841, 0.25 per cent of the population of ||England_and_Wales|| was born in a foreign country, increasing to 1.5 per cent by 1901, 2.6 per cent by 1931 and 4.4 per cent in 1951. In 2014 the immigration ||Net_migration_rate|| was 318,000: Immigration was at 641,000, up from 526,000 in 2013, while the number of emigrants leaving for over a year was 323,000. A recent migration trend has been the arrival of workers from the new EU member states in Eastern Europe, known as the ||A8_countries||. In 2011, citizens of new EU member states made up 13 per cent of immigrants. The UK applied temporary restrictions to citizens of Romania and Bulgaria, which joined the EU in January 2007. Research conducted by the ||Migration_Policy_Institute|| for the ||Equality_and_Human_Rights_Commission|| suggests that, between May 2004 and September 2009, 1.5 million workers migrated from the new EU member states to the UK, most of them Polish. Many subsequently returned home, resulting in a net increase in the number of nationals of the new member states in the UK. The ||Late-2000s_recession|| in the UK reduced economic incentive for Poles to migrate to the UK, making migration temporary and circular. The proportion of foreign-born people in the UK remains slightly below that of many other European countries. Immigration is now contributing to a rising population, with arrivals and UK-born children of migrants accounting for about half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001. 27 per cent of UK live births in 2014 were to mothers born outside the UK, according to official statistics released in 2015. The ONS reported that net migration rose from 2009 to 2010 by 21 per cent to 239,000. In 2013, approximately 208,000 foreign nationals were naturalised as British citizens, the highest number since 1962. This figure fell to around 125,800 in 2014. Between 2009 and 2013, the average British citizenships granted annually was 195,800. The most common previous nationalities of those naturalised in 2014 were ||India||, ||Pakistan||, the ||Philippines||, ||Nigeria||, ||Bangladesh||, ||Nepal||, ||China||, ||South_Africa||, ||Poland|| and ||Somalia||. The total number of grants of settlement, which confer ||Permanent_residency|| in the UK but not citizenship, was approximately 154,700 in 2013, higher than the previous two years.  Estimated number of British citizens living overseas by country in 2006 In 2008, the British Government introduced a ||Points-based_immigration_system_(United_Kingdom)|| for immigration from outside the ||European_Economic_Area|| to replace former schemes, including the Scottish Government's ||Fresh_Talent_Initiative||. In June 2010 a temporary limit on immigration from outside the EU was introduced, aiming to discourage applications before a permanent cap was imposed in April 2011. Emigration was an important feature of British society in the 19th century. Between 1815 and 1930, around 11.4 million people emigrated from Britain and 7.3 million from Ireland. Estimates show that by the end of the 20th century, some 300 million people of British and Irish descent were permanently settled around the globe. Today, at least 5.5 million UK-born people live abroad, mainly in Australia, Spain, the United States and Canada. Education Main article: ||Education_in_the_United_Kingdom|| Education in the United Kingdom is a ||Devolution|| matter, with each country having a separate education system. Considering the four systems together, about 38 per cent of the United Kingdom population has a university or ||College_degree||, which is the highest percentage in Europe, and among the highest percentages in the world. The United Kingdom trails only the United States in terms of representation on lists of top 100 universities. A ||Social_Mobility_and_Child_Poverty_Commission||'s report in 2014 found that privately educated people comprise 7 per cent of the general population of the UK but much larger percentages of the top professions, the most extreme case quoted being 71 per cent of senior judges. In 2018, more than 57,000 children were being ||Homeschooling_in_the_United_Kingdom||. England Main article: ||Education_in_England||  ||Christ_Church,_Oxford||, is part of the ||University_of_Oxford||, which traces its foundations back to c. 1096. Whilst ||Education_in_England|| is the responsibility of the ||Secretary_of_State_for_Education||, the day-to-day administration and funding of state schools is the responsibility of ||Local_education_authority||. Universally free of charge state education was introduced piecemeal between 1870 and 1944. Education is now mandatory from ages 5 to 16, and in England youngsters must stay in education or training until they are 18. In 2011, the ||Trends_in_International_Mathematics_and_Science_Study|| (TIMSS) rated 13–14-year-old pupils in England and Wales 10th in the world for maths and 9th for science. The majority of children are educated in state-sector schools, a small proportion of which select on the grounds of academic ability. Two of the top 10 performing schools in terms of ||GCSE|| results in 2006 were state-run ||Grammar_school||. In 2010, over half of places at the ||University_of_Oxford|| and the ||University_of_Cambridge|| were taken by students from state schools, while the proportion of children in England attending private schools is around 7 per cent, which rises to 18 per cent of those over 16.  ||King%27s_College,_Cambridge|| and ||Clare_College,_Cambridge||, both part of the ||University_of_Cambridge||, which was founded in 1209 Scotland Main article: ||Education_in_Scotland|| ||Education_in_Scotland|| is the responsibility of the ||Cabinet_Secretary_for_Education_and_Lifelong_Learning||, with day-to-day administration and funding of state schools the responsibility of Local Authorities. Two ||Scottish_public_bodies|| have key roles in Scottish education. The ||Scottish_Qualifications_Authority|| is responsible for the development, accreditation, assessment and certification of qualifications other than degrees which are delivered at secondary schools, ||Tertiary_education|| colleges of ||Further_education|| and other centres. ||Learning_and_Teaching_Scotland|| provides advice, resources and staff development to education professionals. Scotland first legislated for compulsory education in 1496. The proportion of children in Scotland attending private schools is just over 4 per cent in 2016, but it has been falling slowly in recent years. Scottish students who attend ||Scottish_universities|| pay neither ||Tuition_fees|| nor graduate endowment charges, as fees were abolished in 2001 and the graduate endowment scheme was abolished in 2008. Wales Main article: ||Education_in_Wales|| The ||Welsh_Government||'s ||Jeremy_Miles|| has responsibility for ||Education_in_Wales||. State funded education is available to children from the age of three whilst the legal obligation for parents to have their children educated, usually at school, begins at age five. A significant proportion of pupils are educated in Welsh whilst the rest are obliged to study the language until the age of 16. Wales' performance in ||Pisa_test|| which compares the academic performance of adolescents around the world has improved in recent years but remains lower than other parts of the UK. In 2019, just under 60% of entrants passed their main English and maths GCSEs. The obligation to receive education in Wales ends at the age of 16. In 2017 and 2018, just under 80% of 16 to 18 and just under 40% of 19 to 24 year olds were in some kind of education or training. Northern Ireland Main article: ||Education_in_Northern_Ireland|| ||Education_in_Northern_Ireland|| is the responsibility of the ||Department_of_Education_(Northern_Ireland)||, although responsibility at a local level is administered by the ||Education_Authority|| which is further sub-divided into five geographical areas. The ||Council_for_the_Curriculum,_Examinations_%26_Assessment|| (CCEA) is the body responsible for advising the ||Northern_Ireland_Executive|| on what should be taught in Northern Ireland's schools, monitoring standards and awarding qualifications. Health Main articles: ||Health_in_the_United_Kingdom|| and ||Healthcare_in_the_United_Kingdom||  The ||Royal_Aberdeen_Children%27s_Hospital||, an ||NHS_Scotland|| specialist ||Children%27s_hospital|| Healthcare in the United Kingdom is a ||Devolution|| and each country has its own system of private and ||Publicly_funded_health_care||. Public healthcare is provided to all ||British_nationality_law|| and is mostly free at the point of need, being paid for from general taxation. The ||World_Health_Organization||, in 2000, ranked the provision of healthcare in the United Kingdom as fifteenth best in Europe and eighteenth in the world. Since 1979 expenditure on healthcare has been increased significantly. The UK spends around 8.4 per cent of its gross domestic product on healthcare, which is 0.5 percentage points below the ||Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development|| average. Regulatory bodies are organised on a UK-wide basis such as the ||General_Medical_Council||, the ||Nursing_and_Midwifery_Council|| and non-governmental-based, such as the ||Royal_College||. Political and operational responsibility for healthcare lies with four national ||Executive_(government)||; ||Healthcare_in_England|| is the responsibility of the UK Government; ||Healthcare_in_Northern_Ireland|| is the responsibility of the ||Northern_Ireland_Executive||; ||Healthcare_in_Scotland|| is the responsibility of the ||Scottish_Government||; and ||Healthcare_in_Wales|| is the responsibility of the ||Welsh_Government||. Each ||National_Health_Service|| has different policies and priorities, resulting in contrasts. Culture Main article: ||Culture_of_the_United_Kingdom|| The culture of the United Kingdom has been influenced by many factors including: the nation's island status; its ||History_of_the_United_Kingdom|| as a western liberal democracy and a major power; as well as being a ||Political_union|| of four countries with each preserving elements of distinctive traditions, customs and symbolism. As a result of the ||British_Empire||, British influence can be observed in the ||English_language||, ||Culture_of_the_United_Kingdom|| and ||Common_law|| of many of its ||List_of_countries_that_have_gained_independence_from_the_United_Kingdom|| including ||Australia||, ||Canada||, ||India||, ||Republic_of_Ireland||, ||New_Zealand||, ||Pakistan||, ||South_Africa|| and the ||United_States||; a common culture coined today as the ||Anglosphere||. The substantial cultural influence of the United Kingdom has led it to be described as a "cultural superpower". A global opinion poll for the BBC saw the United Kingdom ranked the third most positively viewed nation in the world (behind Germany and Canada) in 2013 and 2014. Literature Main article: ||British_literature||  The ||Chandos_portrait||, believed to depict ||William_Shakespeare|| "British literature" refers to literature associated with the United Kingdom, the ||Isle_of_Man|| and the Channel Islands. Most British literature is in the English language. In 2005, some 206,000 books were published in the United Kingdom and in 2006 it was the ||Books_published_per_country_per_year|| in the world. The English playwright and poet ||William_Shakespeare|| is widely regarded as the greatest dramatist of all time. The 20th-century English crime writer ||Agatha_Christie|| is the ||List_of_best-selling_fiction_authors|| of all time. Twelve of the top 25 of 100 novels by British writers chosen by a BBC poll of global critics were written by women; these included works by ||George_Eliot||, ||Virginia_Woolf||, ||Charlotte_Bront%C3%AB|| and ||Emily_Bront%C3%AB||, ||Mary_Shelley||, ||Jane_Austen||, ||Doris_Lessing|| and ||Zadie_Smith||.  A photograph of ||Victorian_era|| novelist ||Charles_Dickens|| ||Scottish_literature|| include ||Arthur_Conan_Doyle|| (the creator of ||Sherlock_Holmes||), ||Walter_Scott||, ||J._M._Barrie||, ||Robert_Louis_Stevenson|| and the poet ||Robert_Burns||. More recently ||Hugh_MacDiarmid|| and ||Neil_M._Gunn|| contributed to the ||Scottish_Renaissance||, with grimmer works from ||Ian_Rankin|| and ||Iain_Banks||. Scotland's capital, Edinburgh, was UNESCO's first worldwide ||City_of_Literature||. Britain's oldest known poem, ||Y_Gododdin||, was composed most likely in the late 6th century. It was written in ||Cumbric_language|| or ||Old_Welsh|| and contains the earliest known reference to ||King_Arthur||. The Arthurian legend was further developed by ||Geoffrey_of_Monmouth||. Poet ||Dafydd_ap_Gwilym|| (fl. 1320–1370) is regarded as one of the greatest European poets of his age. ||Daniel_Owen|| is credited as the first Welsh-language novelist, publishing ||Rhys_Lewis_(novel)|| in 1885. The best-known of the ||Anglo-Welsh_poetry|| are ||Dylan_Thomas|| and ||R._S._Thomas||, the latter nominated for the ||Nobel_Prize_in_Literature|| in 1996. Leading Welsh novelists of the twentieth century include ||Richard_Llewellyn|| and ||Kate_Roberts_(author)||. Irish writers, living at a time when all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom, include ||Oscar_Wilde||, ||Bram_Stoker|| and ||George_Bernard_Shaw||. There have been a number of authors whose origins were from outside the United Kingdom but who moved to the UK. These include ||Joseph_Conrad||, ||T._S._Eliot||, ||Kazuo_Ishiguro||, Sir ||Salman_Rushdie|| and ||Ezra_Pound||.

Exceptional Renaissance and Baroque composers from the 16th and 17th centuries include ||Thomas_Tallis||, ||William_Byrd||, ||Orlando_Gibbons||, ||John_Dowland||, ||Henry_Purcell|| and ||Thomas_Arne||. After moving to London under the reign of ||Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain||, ||George_Frideric_Handel|| became a ||Naturalization|| ||British_nationality_law|| in 1727, when he composed the anthem ||Zadok_the_Priest|| for the coronation of ||George_II_of_Great_Britain||; it became the traditional ceremonial music for anointing all future monarchs. Many of Handel's best-known works, such as ||Messiah_(Handel)||, were written in the English language. Notable 19th- and 20th-century British composers include ||Edward_Elgar||, ||Hubert_Parry||, ||Gustav_Holst||, ||Arthur_Sullivan|| (most famous for working with the librettist ||W._S._Gilbert||), ||Ralph_Vaughan_Williams||, ||William_Walton||, ||Michael_Tippett|| and ||Benjamin_Britten||, pioneer of modern British opera.

The UK is also home to world-renowned symphonic orchestras and choruses such as the ||BBC_Symphony_Orchestra|| and the ||London_Symphony_Chorus||. Notable British conductors include ||Henry_Wood||, ||John_Barbirolli||, ||Malcolm_Sargent||, ||Charles_Groves||, ||Charles_Mackerras|| and ||Simon_Rattle||; at the same time international conductors, not British-born, like ||Georg_Solti|| and ||Bernard_Haitink||, have become at the forefront in Britain for performances of symphonic music and opera. Some of the notable ||Film_score|| composers include ||John_Barry_(composer)||, ||Clint_Mansell||, ||Mike_Oldfield||, ||John_Powell_(composer)||, ||Craig_Armstrong_(composer)||, ||David_Arnold||, ||John_Murphy_(composer)||, ||Monty_Norman|| and ||Harry_Gregson-Williams||. ||Andrew_Lloyd_Webber|| is a prolific composer of musical theatre. His works have dominated London's ||West_End_Theatre|| since the late 20th century and have also been a commercial success worldwide. According to the website of ||The_New_Grove_Dictionary_of_Music_and_Musicians||, the term "||Pop_music||" originated in Britain in the mid-1950s to describe ||Rock_and_roll||'s fusion with the "new youth music". The Oxford Dictionary of Music states that artists such as ||The_Beatles|| and ||The_Rolling_Stones|| drove pop music to the forefront of popular music in the early 1960s. In the following years, Britain widely occupied a part in the development of ||Rock_music||, with British acts pioneering ||Hard_rock||; ||Raga_rock||; ||Art_rock||; ||Heavy_metal_music||; ||Space_rock||; ||Glam_rock||; ||New_wave_music||; ||Gothic_rock||, and ||Ska_punk||. In addition, British acts developed ||Progressive_rock||; ||Psychedelic_rock||; and ||Punk_rock||. Besides rock music, British acts also developed ||Neo_soul|| and created ||Dubstep||.  ||The_Beatles|| are the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed band in popular music, selling over a billion records. ||The_Beatles|| have international sales of over 1 billion units and are the ||List_of_best-selling_music_artists|| and ||Cultural_impact_of_the_Beatles||. Other prominent British contributors to have influenced popular music over the last 50 years include ||The_Rolling_Stones||, ||Pink_Floyd||, ||Queen_(band)||, ||Led_Zeppelin||, the ||Bee_Gees||, and ||Elton_John||, all of whom have worldwide record sales of 200 million or more. The ||Brit_Awards|| are the ||British_Phonographic_Industry|| annual music awards, and some of the British recipients of the ||Brit_Award_for_Outstanding_Contribution_to_Music|| award include; ||The_Who||, ||David_Bowie||, ||Eric_Clapton||, ||Rod_Stewart||, ||The_Police||, and ||Fleetwood_Mac|| (who are a British-American band).

A number of UK cities are known for their music. Acts from Liverpool have had 54 UK chart number 1 hit singles, more per capita than any other city worldwide. Glasgow's contribution to music was recognised in 2008 when it was named a ||UNESCO|| ||City_of_Music_(UNESCO)||. Manchester played a role in the spread of dance music such as ||Acid_house||, and from the mid-1990s, ||Britpop||. London and Bristol are closely associated with the origins of ||Electronic_music|| sub-genres such as ||Drum_and_bass|| and ||Trip_hop||. Birmingham became known as the birthplace of ||Heavy_metal_music||, with the band ||Black_Sabbath|| starting there in the 1960s. ||Pop_music|| remains the most popular music genre by sales and streams of ||Single_(music)||, with 33.4 per cent of that market in 2016, followed by ||Hip_hop_music|| and ||Rhythm_and_blues|| at 24.5 per cent. ||Rock_music|| is not far behind, at 22.6 per cent. The modern UK is known to produce some of the most prominent English-speaking rappers along with the United States, including ||Stormzy||, ||Kano_(rapper)||, ||Yxng_Bane||, ||Ramz_(rapper)|| and ||Skepta||.

Cuisine Main article: ||British_cuisine|| ||British_cuisine|| developed from various influences reflective of its land, settlements, arrivals of new settlers and immigrants, trade and colonialism. ||Celtic_fields|| and animal breeding produced a wide variety of foodstuffs for indigenous ||Celts|| and ||Britons_(historic)||. ||Anglo-Saxon_England|| developed meat and savoury herb stewing techniques before the practice became common in ||Europe||. The ||Norman_conquest|| introduced exotic spices into ||England_in_the_Middle_Ages||. The ||British_Empire|| facilitated a knowledge of ||Indian_cuisine|| with its "strong, penetrating spices and herbs". British cuisine has absorbed the cultural influence of those who have ||Immigration_to_the_United_Kingdom_since_1922||, producing many hybrid dishes, such as the ||Anglo-Indian|| ||Chicken_tikka_masala||. ||Veganism|| and ||Vegetarianism|| diets have increased in Britain in recent years. In 2021, a survey found that 8% of British respondents eat a plant-based diet and 36% of respondents have a favourable view of plant-based diets. Media Main article: ||Media_of_the_United_Kingdom||  The ||Art_Deco|| facade of ||Broadcasting_House|| in London, headquarters of the ||BBC||, the oldest and largest broadcaster in the world The ||BBC||, founded in 1922, is the UK's publicly funded radio, television and Internet broadcasting corporation, and is the oldest and largest broadcaster in the world. It operates numerous television and radio stations in the UK and abroad and its domestic services are funded by the ||Television_licensing_in_the_United_Kingdom||. Other major players in the UK media include ||ITV_plc||, which operates 11 of the 15 regional television broadcasters that make up the ||ITV_(TV_network)||, and ||News_Corporation_(1980%E2%80%932013)||, which owns a number of national newspapers through ||News_International|| such as the most popular ||Tabloid_(newspaper_format)|| ||The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)|| and the longest-established daily "||Broadsheet||" ||The_Times||, as well as holding a large stake in satellite broadcaster ||British_Sky_Broadcasting|| until 2018. London dominates the media sector in the UK: national newspapers and television and radio are largely based there, although Manchester is also a significant national media centre. Edinburgh and Glasgow, and Cardiff, are important centres of newspaper and broadcasting production in Scotland and Wales, respectively. The UK publishing sector, including books, directories and databases, journals, magazines and business media, newspapers and news agencies, has a combined turnover of around £20 billion and employs around 167,000 people. In 2015, the UK published 2,710 book titles per million inhabitants, more than any other country, much of this being exported to other ||Anglophone|| countries. In 2009, it was estimated that individuals viewed a mean of 3.75 hours of television per day and 2.81 hours of radio. In that year the main BBC ||Public_service_broadcasting_in_the_United_Kingdom|| channels accounted for an estimated 28.4 per cent of all television viewing; the three main independent channels accounted for 29.5 per cent and the increasingly important other satellite and digital channels for the remaining 42.1 per cent. Sales of newspapers have fallen since the 1970s and in 2010 41 per cent of people reported reading a daily national newspaper. In 2010, 82.5 per cent of the UK population were Internet users, the highest proportion amongst the 20 countries with the largest total number of users in that year. Philosophy Main article: ||British_philosophy|| The United Kingdom is famous for the tradition of 'British Empiricism', a branch of the philosophy of knowledge that states that only knowledge verified by experience is valid, and 'Scottish Philosophy', sometimes referred to as the '||Scottish_School_of_Common_Sense||'. The most famous philosophers of British Empiricism are ||John_Locke||, ||George_Berkeley|| and ||David_Hume||; while ||Dugald_Stewart||, ||Thomas_Reid|| and ||Sir_William_Hamilton,_9th_Baronet|| were major exponents of the Scottish "common sense" school. Two Britons are also notable for the ethical theory of ||Utilitarianism||, a moral philosophy first used by ||Jeremy_Bentham|| and later by ||John_Stuart_Mill|| in his short work ||Utilitarianism_(book)||. Sport Main article: ||Sport_in_the_United_Kingdom||  ||Wembley_Stadium||, London, home of the ||England_national_football_team||, is the ||List_of_most_expensive_stadiums||. ||Association_football||, ||Tennis||, ||Table_tennis||, ||Badminton||, ||Rugby_union||, ||Rugby_league||, ||Rugby_sevens||, ||Golf||, ||Boxing||, ||Netball||, ||Water_polo||, ||Field_hockey||, ||English_billiards||, ||Darts||, ||Rowing_(sport)||, ||Rounders|| and ||Cricket|| originated or were substantially developed in the UK, with the rules and codes of many modern sports invented and codified in the late 19th century ||Victorian_Britain||. In 2012, the President of the IOC, ||Jacques_Rogge||, stated, "This great, sports-loving country is widely recognised as the birthplace of modern sport. It was here that the concepts of sportsmanship and fair play were first codified into clear rules and regulations. It was here that sport was included as an educational tool in the school curriculum". A 2003 poll found that football is the most popular ||Sport_in_the_United_Kingdom||. England is recognised by ||FIFA|| as the birthplace of club football, and ||The_Football_Association|| is the oldest of its kind, with the ||Laws_of_the_Game_(association_football)|| first drafted in 1863 by ||Ebenezer_Cobb_Morley||. Each of the Home Nations has its own football association, national team and ||League_system|| and individually are the governing members of the ||International_Football_Association_Board|| alongside ||FIFA||. The English top division, the ||Premier_League||, is the most watched football league in the world. The first international football match was contested by ||England_national_football_team|| and ||Scotland_national_football_team|| on 30 November 1872. England, Scotland, ||Wales_national_football_team|| and ||Northern_Ireland_national_football_team|| usually compete as separate countries in international competitions.  The ||Millennium_Stadium|| of ||Cardiff|| opened for the ||1999_Rugby_World_Cup||. In 2003, ||Rugby_union|| was ranked the second most popular sport in the UK. The sport was created in ||Rugby_School||, Warwickshire, and the ||1871_England_versus_Scotland_rugby_union_match|| took place on 27 March 1871 between ||England_national_rugby_union_team|| and ||Scotland_national_rugby_union_team||. England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, France and Italy compete in the ||Six_Nations_Championship||; the premier international tournament in the northern hemisphere. ||Sport_governing_body|| in ||Rugby_union_in_England||, ||Rugby_union_in_Scotland||, ||Rugby_union_in_Wales|| and ||Rugby_union_in_Ireland|| organise and regulate the game separately. Every four years, England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales make a combined team known as the ||British_and_Irish_Lions||. The team tours ||Australia||, ||New_Zealand|| and ||South_Africa||. Cricket was invented in England, and its ||Laws_of_cricket|| were established by the ||Marylebone_Cricket_Club|| in 1788. The ||England_cricket_team||, controlled by the ||England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board||, and the ||Irish_cricket_team||, controlled by ||Cricket_Ireland|| are the only national teams in the UK with ||Test_cricket||. Team members are drawn from the main county sides, and include both English and Welsh players. Cricket is distinct from football and rugby where Wales and England field separate national teams, although Wales had fielded its own team in the past. ||Cricket_in_Scotland|| players have played for England because ||Scotland_national_cricket_team|| does not have Test status and has only recently started to play in ||One_Day_International||. Scotland, England (and Wales), and Ireland (including Northern Ireland) have competed at the ||Cricket_World_Cup||, with England winning the tournament in 2019. There is a professional ||County_Championship|| in which clubs representing 17 English counties and 1 Welsh county compete.  ||The_Championships,_Wimbledon||, the oldest ||Grand_Slam_(tennis)|| tennis tournament, is held in ||Wimbledon,_London||, London every June and July. The modern game of ||Tennis|| originated in Birmingham, England, in the 1860s, before spreading around the world. The world's oldest tennis tournament, the ||Wimbledon_championships||, first occurred in 1877, and today the event takes place over two weeks in late June and early July. The UK is closely associated with ||Motorsport||. Many teams and drivers in ||Formula_One|| (F1) are based in the UK, and the country has won more ||List_of_Formula_One_World_Drivers%27_Champions|| and ||List_of_Formula_One_World_Constructors%27_Champions|| ||Formula_One_World_Championship|| than any other. The UK hosted the first F1 Grand Prix in 1950 at ||Silverstone_Circuit||, the location of the ||British_Grand_Prix|| held each year in July.  ||The_Royal_and_Ancient_Golf_Club_of_St_Andrews||, Scotland, the home of golf. The standard 18 hole golf course was created at St Andrews in 1764. ||Golf|| is the sixth most popular sport, by participation, in the UK. Although ||The_Royal_and_Ancient_Golf_Club_of_St_Andrews|| in Scotland is the sport's home course, the world's oldest golf course is actually Musselburgh Links' Old Golf Course. In 1764, the standard 18-hole golf course was created at St Andrews when members modified the course from 22 to 18 holes. The oldest golf tournament in the world, and the first major championship in golf, ||The_Open_Championship||, is played annually on the weekend of the third Friday in July. ||Rugby_league|| originated in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire in 1895 and is generally played in ||Northern_England||. A single 'Great Britain Lions' team had competed in the ||Rugby_League_World_Cup|| and Test match games, but this changed in 2008 when ||England_national_rugby_league_team||, ||Scotland_national_rugby_league_team|| and ||Ireland_national_rugby_league_team|| competed as separate nations. Great Britain is still retained as the full national team. ||Super_League|| is the highest level of professional rugby league in the UK and Europe. It consists of 11 teams from Northern England, and one each from London, Wales and France. The ||Marquess_of_Queensberry_rules||, the code of general rules in ||Boxing||, was named after ||John_Douglas,_9th_Marquess_of_Queensberry|| in 1867, and formed the basis of modern boxing. ||Snooker|| is another of the UK's popular sporting exports, with the world championships held annually in ||Sheffield||. In Northern Ireland, ||Gaelic_football|| and ||Hurling|| are popular team sports, both in terms of participation and spectating. Irish expatriates in the UK and the US also play them. ||Shinty|| (or camanachd) is popular in the ||Scottish_Highlands||. ||Highland_games|| are held in spring and summer in Scotland, celebrating Scottish and ||Celt|| culture and heritage, especially that of the Scottish Highlands. The United Kingdom has hosted the ||Summer_Olympic_Games|| on three occasions in ||1908_Summer_Olympics||, ||1948_Summer_Olympics|| and ||2012_Summer_Olympics||, with London acting as the host city for all three games respectively. The upcoming ||2022_Commonwealth_Games||, scheduled to be hosted in Birmingham, will mark the seventh time the UK has hosted the ||Commonwealth_Games||. Symbols Main article: ||Symbols_of_the_United_Kingdom,_the_Channel_Islands_and_the_Isle_of_Man||  The Statue of ||Britannia|| in ||Plymouth||. Britannia is a ||National_personification|| of the UK. The ||Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom|| is the ||Union_Flag|| (also referred to as the Union Jack). It was created in 1606 by the superimposition of the ||Flag_of_England||, representing ||Saint_George||, on the ||Flag_of_Scotland||, representing ||Saint_Andrew||, and was updated in 1801 with the addition of ||Saint_Patrick%27s_Flag||. Wales is not represented in the Union Flag, as Wales had been conquered and annexed to England prior to the formation of the United Kingdom. The possibility of redesigning the Union Flag to include representation of Wales has not been completely ruled out. The ||National_anthem|| of the United Kingdom is "||God_Save_the_Queen||", with "Queen" replaced with "King" in the lyrics whenever the monarch is a man. ||Britannia|| is a ||National_personification|| of the United Kingdom, originating from ||Roman_Britain||. Britannia is symbolised as a young woman with brown or golden hair, wearing a ||Corinthian_helmet|| and white robes. She holds ||Poseidon||'s three-pronged trident and a shield, bearing the Union Flag. Beside ||The_Lion_and_the_Unicorn|| and the ||Welsh_Dragon|| of heraldry, the ||Bulldog|| is an iconic animal and commonly represented with the Union Jack. It has been associated with Winston Churchill's defiance of ||Nazi_Germany||. A now rare personification is a character originating in the 18th century, ||John_Bull||, a portly country gentleman dressed in a ||Top_hat|| and ||Tailcoat|| with a Union Jack ||Waistcoat||, often accompanied by a bulldog. The ||Floral_emblem|| of the three kingdoms are the ||Tudor_rose|| for England, the ||Thistle|| for Scotland and the ||Shamrock|| for Northern Ireland; they are sometimes shown intertwined to represent unity. The ||Daffodil|| and the ||Leek|| are the symbols of Wales. Alternatives include the ||Royal_Oak|| for England and the ||Flax|| flower for Northern Ireland. See also ||Outline_of_the_United_Kingdom|| ||Outline_of_England|| ||Outline_of_Northern_Ireland|| ||Outline_of_Scotland|| ||Outline_of_Wales|| ||Index_of_United_Kingdom-related_articles|| ||International_rankings_of_the_United_Kingdom|| ||Historiography_of_the_United_Kingdom|| ||Historiography_of_the_British_Empire|| ||United_Kingdom%E2%80%93Crown_Dependencies_Customs_Union|| Notes  There is no authorised version of the national anthem as the words are a matter of tradition; only the first verse is usually sung. No statute has been enacted designating "God Save the Queen" as the official anthem. In the English tradition, such laws are not necessary; ||Proclamation|| and usage are sufficient to make it the national anthem. "God Save the Queen" also serves as the ||Honors_music|| for certain ||Commonwealth_realms||. The words Queen, she, her, used at present (in the reign of Elizabeth II), are replaced by King, he, him, his when the monarch is male.  Scots, Ulster Scots, Welsh, Cornish, Scottish Gaelic and Irish are classed as ||Regional_language|| or ||Minority_language|| languages under the ||Council_of_Europe||'s ||European_Charter_for_Regional_or_Minority_Languages||. These include defined obligations to promote those languages. See also ||Languages_of_the_United_Kingdom||. Welsh has limited ||De_jure|| official status in Wales, as well as in the provision of national government services provided for Wales.  "This category could include Polish responses from the country specific question for Scotland which would have been outputted to 'Other White' and then included under 'White' for UK. 'White Africans' may also have been recorded under 'Other White' and then included under 'White' for UK."  83.6% are ||White_British||/||White_Irish||.  Although the United Kingdom has traditionally been seen as a unitary state, an alternative description of the UK as a "union state", put forward by, among others, ||Vernon_Bogdanor||, has become increasingly influential since the adoption of devolution in the 1990s. A union state is considered to differ from a unitary state in that while it maintains a central authority it also recognises the authority of historic rights and infrastructures of its component parts.  Some of the devolved countries, Crown dependencies and British Overseas Territories issue their own sterling banknotes or currencies, or use another nation's currency. See ||List_of_British_currencies|| for more information  Also in observed by the ||Crown_dependencies||, and in the two British Overseas Territories of ||Gibraltar|| and ||Saint_Helena,_Ascension_and_Tristan_da_Cunha|| (though in the latter, without daylight saving time). For further information, see ||Time_in_the_United_Kingdom#British_territories||.  Except two overseas territories: ||Gibraltar|| and the ||British_Indian_Ocean_Territory||.  ||Telephone_numbers_in_the_United_Kingdom#Telephone_numbers_in_Overseas_Territories||.  The domain is also reserved for the UK, but has been little used.  Usage is mixed. The and use Britain as a synonym for the United Kingdom. Some prefer to use Britain as shorthand for ||Great_Britain||. The British ||Cabinet_Office||'s ||Government_Digital_Service|| for use on ||Gov.uk|| recommends: "Use UK and United Kingdom in preference to Britain and British (UK business, UK foreign policy, ambassador and high commissioner). But British embassy, not UK embassy."  The United Kingdom does not have a codified constitution but an unwritten one formed of Acts of Parliament, court judgments, traditions, and conventions., The Constitution Unit of UCL, 9 August 2018, retrieved 6 February 2020  The 1921 ||Anglo-Irish_Treaty|| resolved the ||Irish_War_of_Independence||. When it took effect one year later, it established the ||Irish_Free_State|| as a separate ||Dominion|| within the ||Commonwealth_of_Nations||. In 1927 the ||Royal_and_Parliamentary_Titles_Act_1927|| changed the name of the UK to reflect this.  Compare to section 1 of both of the 1800 ||Acts_of_Union_(1800)|| which reads: the Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland shall...be united into one Kingdom, by the Name of "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland".  The 2011 Census recorded Gypsies and Travellers as a separate ethnic group for the first time.  In the 2011 Census, for the purpose of harmonising results to make them comparable across the UK, the ONS includes individuals in Scotland who classified themselves in the "African" category (29,638 people), which in the Scottish version of the census is separate from "Caribbean or Black" (6,540 people), in this "Black or Black British" category. The ONS note that "the African categories used in Scotland could potentially capture White/Asian/Other African in addition to Black identities".  Berkeley is in fact Irish but was called a 'British empiricist' due to the territory of what is now known as the ||Republic_of_Ireland|| being in the UK at the time References  .

The UK Internal Market Act gives ministers sweeping powers to enforce mutual recognition and non-discrimination across the four jurisdictions. Existing differences and some social and health matters are exempted but these are much less extensive than the exemptions permitted under the EU Internal Market provisions. Only after an amendment in the House of Lords, the Bill was amended to provide a weak and non-binding consent mechanism for amendments (equivalent to the Sewel Convention) to the list of exemptions. The result is that, while the devolved governments retain regulatory competences, these are undermined by the fact that goods and services originating in, or imported into, England can be marketed anywhere.  ||Michael_Kenny_(political_scientist)||; ||Nicola_McEwen|| (1 March 2021).

The White Paper had indicated that this was to be the approach taken in the legislation. The Scottish Parliament is not to be seen as a reflection of the settled will of the people of Scotland or of popular sovereignty but as a reflection of its subordination to a higher legal authority. Following the logic of this argument, the power of the Scottish Parliament to legislate can be withdrawn or overridden...  Elliot, M. (2004). .

Notwithstanding substantial differences among the schemes, an important common factor is that the UK Parliament has not renounced legislative sovereignty in relation to the three nations concerned. For example, the Scottish Parliament is empowered to enact primary legislation on all matters, save those in relation to which competence is explicitly denied ... but this power to legislate on what may be termed "devolved matters" is concurrent with the Westminster Parliament's general power to legislate for Scotland on any matter at all, including devolved matters ...

The British parliament has the power to abolish the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly by a simple majority vote in both houses, but since both were sanctioned by referenda, it would be politically difficult to abolish them without the sanction of a further vote by the people. In this way, several of the constitutional measures introduced by the Blair government appear to be entrenched and not subject to a simple exercise of parliamentary sovereignty at Westminster.

Parliamentary Affairs. 52 (1): 19–31 [p. 23]. ||Doi_(identifier)||:. [T]he distinctive involvement of two governments in the Northern Irish problem means that Northern Ireland's new arrangements rest upon an intergovernmental agreement. If this can be equated with a treaty, it could be argued that the forthcoming distribution of power between Westminster and Belfast has similarities with divisions specified in the written constitutions of federal states...Although the Agreement makes the general proviso that Westminster's 'powers to make legislation for Northern Ireland' remains 'unaffected', without an explicit categorical reference to reserved matters, it may be more difficult than in Scotland or Wales for devolved powers to be repatriated. The retraction of devolved powers would not merely entail consultation in Northern Ireland backed implicitly by the absolute power of parliamentary sovereignty but also the renegotiation of an intergovernmental agreement.  .
