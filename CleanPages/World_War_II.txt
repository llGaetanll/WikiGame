abbreviated as WWII or WW2, was a ||World_war|| that lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved ||World_War_II_by_country||—including all of the great powers—forming two opposing ||Military_alliance||: the ||Allies_of_World_War_II|| and the ||Axis_powers||. In a ||Total_war|| directly involving more than 100 million ||Military_personnel|| from more than 30 countries, the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the ||War_effort||, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. ||Air_warfare_of_World_War_II|| in the conflict, enabling the ||Strategic_bombing|| of population centres and the only two uses of ||Nuclear_weapon|| in war. World War II was by far the ||List_of_wars_by_death_toll|| in human history; it resulted in ||World_War_II_casualties||, a majority being civilians. Tens of millions of people died due to ||Genocide|| (including ||The_Holocaust||), ||Starvation||, ||Massacre||, and ||Disease||. In the wake of the Axis defeat, ||Allied-occupied_Germany|| and ||Occupation_of_Japan||, and ||War_crimes|| tribunals were conducted ||Nuremberg_Trials|| and ||International_Military_Tribunal_for_the_Far_East||. The exact ||Causes_of_World_War_II|| are debated, but contributing factors included the ||Second_Italo-Ethiopian_War||, the ||Spanish_Civil_War||, the ||Second_Sino-Japanese_War||, the ||Soviet%E2%80%93Japanese_border_conflicts|| and rising European tensions since ||World_War_I||. World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when ||Nazi_Germany||, under ||Adolf_Hitler||, ||Invasion_of_Poland||. The ||United_Kingdom|| and ||French_Third_Republic|| subsequently ||Declared_war|| on Germany on 3 September. Under the ||Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact|| of August 1939, Germany and the ||Soviet_Union|| had partitioned Poland and marked out their "||Sphere_of_influence||" across ||Winter_War||, ||Occupation_of_the_Baltic_states|| and ||Soviet_occupation_of_Bessarabia_and_northern_Bukovina||. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of ||Military_campaign|| and ||Tripartite_Pact||, Germany conquered or controlled much of ||Continental_Europe||, and formed the ||Axis_powers|| with ||Fascist_Italy_(1922%E2%80%931943)|| and ||Empire_of_Japan|| (along with other countries later on). Following the onset of campaigns in ||Western_Desert_Campaign|| and ||East_African_Campaign_(World_War_II)||, and the ||Battle_of_France|| in mid-1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the ||British_Empire||, with war in the ||Balkan_Campaign_(World_War_II)||, the aerial ||Battle_of_Britain||, ||The_Blitz|| of the UK, and the ||Battle_of_the_Atlantic||. On 22 June 1941, Germany led the European Axis powers in ||Operation_Barbarossa||, opening ||Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)||, the largest land theatre of war in history. Japan, which aimed to ||Greater_East_Asia_Co-Prosperity_Sphere||, was ||Second_Sino-Japanese_War|| with the ||Republic_of_China_(1912%E2%80%931949)|| by 1937. In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories with near-simultaneous ||Japanese_expansion_(1941%E2%80%931942)||, including an ||Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor|| which resulted in the ||United_States_declaration_of_war_on_Japan|| against Japan. Therefore the European Axis powers declared war on the United States in solidarity. Japan soon captured much of the western Pacific, but its advances were halted in 1942 after losing the critical ||Battle_of_Midway||; later, Germany and Italy were ||Second_Battle_of_El_Alamein|| and at ||Battle_of_Stalingrad|| in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943—including a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the ||Allied_invasion_of_Sicily|| and ||Allied_invasion_of_Italy||, and Allied offensives in the Pacific—cost the Axis powers their initiative and forced it into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies ||Normandy_landings||, while the Soviet Union ||Stalin%27s_ten_blows|| and turned towards Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945, Japan suffered reversals in mainland Asia, while the Allies crippled the ||Imperial_Japanese_Navy|| and captured key western Pacific islands. The war in Europe concluded with the liberation of ||German-occupied_Europe||, and the ||Western_Allied_invasion_of_Germany|| and the Soviet Union, culminating in the ||Battle_of_Berlin|| to Soviet troops, ||Death_of_Adolf_Hitler|| and the ||German_Instrument_of_Surrender|| on ||Victory_in_Europe_Day||. Following the ||Potsdam_Declaration|| by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender on its terms, the United States ||Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki|| on the Japanese cities of ||Hiroshima||, on 6 August, and ||Nagasaki||, on 9 August. Faced with an imminent ||Operation_Downfall||, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, and the Soviet’s declared entry into the war against Japan on the eve of ||Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria||, Japan announced on 15 August its intention to surrender, then signed the surrender document on ||Victory_over_Japan_Day||, cementing total victory in Asia for the Allies. World War II changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe. The ||United_Nations|| (UN) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts, with the victorious ||Great_power||—China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States—becoming the ||Permanent_members_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council|| of its ||United_Nations_Security_Council||. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival ||Superpower||, setting the stage for the nearly half-century-long ||Cold_War||. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the ||Decolonisation_of_Africa|| and ||Decolonisation_of_Asia||. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards ||Post%E2%80%93World_War_II_economic_expansion||. Political and economic integration, especially ||European_integration||, began as an effort to forestall future hostilities, end pre-war enmities and forge a sense of common identity.

The dates for the beginning of the war in the Pacific include the start of the ||Second_Sino-Japanese_War|| on 7 July 1937, or the earlier ||Japanese_invasion_of_Manchuria||, on 19 September 1931. Others follow the British historian ||A._J._P._Taylor||, who held that the Sino-Japanese War and war in Europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously, and the two wars became World War II in 1941. Other starting dates sometimes used for World War II include the ||Second_Italo-Ethiopian_War|| on 3 October 1935. The British historian ||Antony_Beevor|| views the beginning of World War II as the ||Battles_of_Khalkhin_Gol|| fought between ||Empire_of_Japan|| and the forces of ||People%27s_Republic_of_Mongolia|| and the ||Soviet_Union|| from May to September 1939. Others view the ||Spanish_Civil_War|| as the start or prelude to World War II. The exact date of the war's end is also not universally agreed upon. It was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the ||Armistice|| of 14 August 1945 (||Victory_over_Japan_Day||), rather than with the formal ||Surrender_of_Japan|| on 2 September 1945, which officially ||End_of_World_War_II_in_Asia||. A ||Treaty_of_San_Francisco|| was signed in 1951. A 1990 ||Treaty_on_the_Final_Settlement_with_Respect_to_Germany|| allowed the ||German_reunification|| to take place and resolved most post-World War II issues. No formal peace treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union was ever signed, although the state of war between the two countries was terminated by the ||Soviet%E2%80%93Japanese_Joint_Declaration_of_1956||, which also restored full diplomatic relations between them. Background Main article: ||Causes_of_World_War_II|| Europe ||World_War_I|| had radically altered the ||Geopolitics|| European map, with the defeat of the ||Central_Powers||—including ||Austria-Hungary||, ||German_Empire||, ||Kingdom_of_Bulgaria|| and the ||Ottoman_Empire||—and the 1917 ||October_Revolution|| in ||Russian_Republic||, which led to the founding of the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, the victorious ||Allies_of_World_War_I||, such as France, ||Belgium||, Italy, ||Romania||, and ||Greece||, gained territory, and new ||Nation-states|| were created out of the ||Dissolution_of_Austria-Hungary|| and the ||Dissolution_of_the_Ottoman_Empire|| and ||Russian_Empire||.  The ||League_of_Nations|| assembly, held in ||Geneva||, ||Switzerland||, 1930 To prevent a future world war, the ||League_of_Nations|| was created during the ||Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919||. The organisation's primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through ||Collective_security||, military and ||Washington_Naval_Treaty||, and settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration. Despite strong ||Pacifist|| sentiment ||Aftermath_of_World_War_I||, ||Irredentist|| and ||Revanchist|| ||Nationalism|| emerged in several European states in the same period. These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of the significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses imposed by the ||Treaty_of_Versailles||. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all ||German_colonial_empire||, while German annexation of other states was prohibited, ||World_War_I_reparations|| were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's ||Reichswehr||. The German Empire was dissolved in the ||German_Revolution_of_1918%E2%80%931919||, and a democratic government, later known as the ||Weimar_Republic||, was created. The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the ||Right-wing_politics|| and ||Left-wing_politics||. Italy, as an Entente ally, had made some post-war territorial gains; however, Italian nationalists were angered that the ||Treaty_of_London_(1915)|| by the United Kingdom and France to secure Italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement. From 1922 to 1925, the ||Italian_Fascism|| movement led by ||Benito_Mussolini|| seized power in Italy with a nationalist, ||Totalitarianism||, and ||Class_collaboration|| agenda that abolished representative democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing and liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making Italy a ||World_power||, and promising the creation of a "||New_Roman_Empire||".  ||Adolf_Hitler|| at a German ||Nazism|| political rally in ||Nuremberg||, August 1933 ||Adolf_Hitler||, after an ||Beer_Hall_Putsch|| in 1923, eventually ||Adolf_Hitler%27s_rise_to_power|| in 1933 when ||Paul_Von_Hindenburg|| and the Reichstag appointed him. He abolished democracy, espousing a ||New_Order_(Nazism)||, and soon began a massive ||German_re-armament||. Meanwhile, France, to secure its alliance, ||Franco-Italian_Agreement||, which Italy desired as a colonial possession. The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the ||Saar_(League_of_Nations)|| was legally reunited with Germany, and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, accelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced ||Conscription||. The United Kingdom, France and Italy formed the ||Stresa_Front|| in April 1935 in order to contain Germany, a key step towards ||Military_globalisation||; however, that June, the United Kingdom made an ||Anglo-German_Naval_Agreement|| with Germany, easing prior restrictions. The Soviet Union, concerned by ||Drang_nach_Osten||, drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France. Before taking effect, though, the ||Franco-Soviet_pact|| was required to go through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations, which rendered it essentially toothless. The United States, concerned with events in Europe and Asia, passed the ||Neutrality_Acts_of_1930s|| in August of the same year. Hitler defied the Versailles and ||Locarno_treaties|| by ||Remilitarization_of_the_Rhineland|| in March 1936, encountering little opposition due to the policy of ||Appeasement||. In October 1936, Germany and Italy formed the ||Rome%E2%80%93Berlin_Axis||. A month later, Germany and Japan signed the ||Anti-Comintern_Pact||, which Italy joined the following year. Asia The ||Kuomintang|| (KMT) party in China launched a ||Northern_Expedition|| against ||Warlord_Era|| and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon embroiled in ||Chinese_Civil_War|| against its former ||Chinese_Communist_Party|| allies and ||Central_Plains_War||. In 1931, an ||Statism_in_Sh%C5%8Dwa_Japan|| ||Empire_of_Japan||, which had long sought influence in China as the first step of what its government saw as the country's ||Hakko_ichiu||, staged the ||Mukden_Incident|| as a pretext to ||Japanese_invasion_of_Manchuria|| and establish the ||Puppet_state|| of ||Manchukuo||. China appealed to the ||League_of_Nations|| to stop the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being ||Lytton_Report|| for its incursion into Manchuria. The two nations then fought several battles, in ||28_January_Incident||, ||Battle_of_Rehe|| and ||Defense_of_the_Great_Wall||, until the ||Tanggu_Truce|| was signed in 1933. Thereafter, Chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to Japanese aggression in ||Pacification_of_Manchukuo||, and ||Actions_in_Inner_Mongolia_(1933%E2%80%931936)||. After the 1936 ||Xi%27an_Incident||, the Kuomintang and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present ||Second_United_Front|| to oppose Japan. Pre-war events Italian invasion of Ethiopia (1935)  ||Benito_Mussolini|| inspecting troops during the ||Second_Italo-Ethiopian_War||, 1935 Main article: ||Second_Italo-Ethiopian_War|| The ||Second_Italo-Ethiopian_War|| was a brief ||Colonial_war|| that began in October 1935 and ended in May 1936. The war began with the invasion of the ||Ethiopian_Empire|| (also known as ||Ethiopia#Etymology||) by the armed forces of the ||Kingdom_of_Italy|| (Regno d'Italia), which was launched from ||Italian_Somaliland|| and ||Italian_Eritrea||. The war resulted in the ||Military_occupation|| of Ethiopia and its ||Annexation|| into the newly created colony of ||Italian_East_Africa|| (Africa Orientale Italiana, or AOI); in addition it exposed the weakness of the ||League_of_Nations|| as a force to preserve peace. Both Italy and Ethiopia were member nations, ||Appeasement|| when the former clearly violated Article X of the League's ||Covenant_of_the_League_of_Nations||. The United Kingdom and France supported imposing sanctions on Italy for the invasion, but the sanctions were not fully enforced and failed to end the Italian invasion. Italy subsequently dropped its objections to Germany's goal of absorbing ||Federal_State_of_Austria||. Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) Main article: ||Spanish_Civil_War||  The ||Bombing_of_Guernica|| in 1937, during the ||Spanish_Civil_War||, sparked fears abroad in Europe that the next war would be based on bombing of cities with very high civilian casualties. When civil war broke out in Spain, Hitler and Mussolini lent military support to the ||Nationalist_faction_(Spanish_Civil_War)||, led by General ||Francisco_Franco||. Italy supported the Nationalists to a greater extent than the Nazis did: altogether Mussolini sent to Spain more than 70,000 ground troops and 6,000 aviation personnel, as well as about 720 aircraft. The Soviet Union supported the existing government of the ||Second_Spanish_Republic||. More than 30,000 foreign volunteers, known as the ||International_Brigades||, also fought against the Nationalists. Both Germany and the Soviet Union used this ||Proxy_war|| as an opportunity to test in combat their most advanced weapons and tactics. The Nationalists won the civil war in April 1939; Franco, now dictator, remained officially neutral during World War II but ||Spain_during_World_War_II||. His greatest collaboration with Germany was the sending of ||Blue_Division|| to fight on the ||Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)||. Japanese invasion of China (1937) Main article: ||Second_Sino-Japanese_War||  ||Japanese_Imperial_Army|| soldiers during the ||Battle_of_Shanghai||, 1937 In July 1937, Japan captured the former Chinese imperial capital of ||Beijing|| after instigating the ||Marco_Polo_Bridge_Incident||, which culminated in the Japanese campaign to invade all of China. The Soviets quickly signed a ||Sino-Soviet_Non-Aggression_Pact|| to lend ||Materiel|| support, effectively ending China's prior ||Sino-German_cooperation_(1926%E2%80%931941)||. From September to November, the Japanese attacked ||Battle_of_Taiyuan||, engaged the ||National_Revolutionary_Army|| ||Battle_of_Xinkou||, and fought ||Chinese_Communist_Party|| ||Battle_of_Pingxingguan||. ||Generalissimo|| ||Chiang_Kai-shek|| deployed his ||List_of_German-trained_divisions_of_the_National_Revolutionary_Army|| to ||Battle_of_Shanghai||, but after three months of fighting, Shanghai fell. The Japanese continued to push the Chinese forces back, ||Battle_of_Nanking|| in December 1937. After the fall of Nanking, tens or hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians and disarmed combatants were ||Nanjing_Massacre||. In March 1938, Nationalist Chinese forces won their ||Battle_of_Taierzhuang||, but then the city of ||Xuzhou|| ||Battle_of_Xuzhou|| in May. In June 1938, Chinese forces stalled the Japanese advance by ||1938_Yellow_River_flood||; this manoeuvre bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defences at ||Wuhan||, but the ||Battle_of_Wuhan|| by October. Japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to achieve; instead, the Chinese government relocated inland to ||Chongqing|| and continued the war. Soviet–Japanese border conflicts Main article: ||Soviet%E2%80%93Japanese_border_conflicts||  ||Red_Army|| artillery unit during the ||Battle_of_Lake_Khasan||, 1938 In the mid-to-late 1930s, Japanese forces in ||Manchukuo|| had sporadic border clashes with the Soviet Union and ||Mongolian_People%27s_Republic||. The Japanese doctrine of ||Hokushin-ron||, which emphasised Japan's expansion northward, was favoured by the Imperial Army during this time. With the Japanese defeat at ||Battles_of_Khalkhin_Gol|| in 1939, the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War and ally Nazi Germany pursuing neutrality with the Soviets, this policy would prove difficult to maintain. Japan and the Soviet Union eventually signed a ||Soviet%E2%80%93Japanese_Neutrality_Pact|| in April 1941, and Japan adopted the doctrine of ||Nanshin-ron||, promoted by the Navy, which took its focus southward, eventually leading to its war with the United States and the Western Allies. European occupations and agreements  ||Neville_Chamberlain||, , ||Hitler||, ||Benito_Mussolini||, and ||Galeazzo_Ciano|| pictured just before signing the ||Munich_Agreement||, 29 September 1938 In Europe, Germany and Italy were becoming more aggressive. In March 1938, Germany ||Anschluss||, again provoking ||Appeasement|| from other European powers. Encouraged, Hitler began pressing German claims on the ||Sudetenland||, an area of ||Czechoslovakia|| with a predominantly ||Germans|| population. Soon the United Kingdom and France followed the appeasement policy of British Prime Minister ||Neville_Chamberlain|| and conceded this territory to Germany in the ||Munich_Agreement||, which was made against the wishes of the Czechoslovak government, in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands. Soon afterwards, Germany and Italy forced Czechoslovakia to ||First_Vienna_Award|| to Hungary, and Poland annexed Czechoslovakia's ||Zaolzie|| region. Although all of Germany's stated demands had been satisfied by the agreement, privately Hitler was furious that British interference had prevented him from seizing all of Czechoslovakia in one operation. In subsequent speeches Hitler attacked British and Jewish "war-mongers" and in January 1939 ||Plan_Z|| to challenge British naval supremacy.

Hitler also delivered an ||1939_German_ultimatum_to_Lithuania|| on 20 March 1939, forcing the concession of the ||Klaip%C4%97da_Region||, formerly the German Memelland.  German Foreign Minister ||Joachim_von_Ribbentrop|| (right) and the Soviet leader ||Joseph_Stalin||, after signing the ||Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact||, 23 August 1939 Greatly alarmed and with Hitler making further demands on the ||Free_City_of_Danzig||, the United Kingdom and France ||Anglo-Polish_military_alliance#British_Guarantee_to_Poland||; when ||Italian_invasion_of_Albania|| in April 1939, the same guarantee was extended to the ||Kingdom_of_Romania|| and ||Kingdom_of_Greece||. Shortly after the ||Franco-Polish_alliance_(1921)||-||Anglo-Polish_military_alliance|| pledge to Poland, Germany and Italy formalised their own alliance with the ||Pact_of_Steel||. Hitler accused the United Kingdom and Poland of trying to "encircle" Germany and renounced the ||Anglo-German_Naval_Agreement|| and the ||German%E2%80%93Polish_Non-Aggression_Pact||. The situation reached a general crisis in late August as German troops continued to mobilise against the Polish border. On 23 August, when tripartite negotiations about a military alliance between France, the United Kingdom and Soviet Union stalled, the Soviet Union signed ||Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact|| with Germany. This pact had a secret protocol that defined German and Soviet "spheres of influence" (western ||Second_Polish_Republic|| and Lithuania for Germany; ||Territories_of_Poland_annexed_by_the_Soviet_Union||, Finland, ||Estonia||, ||Latvia|| and ||Bessarabia|| for the Soviet Union), and raised the question of continuing Polish independence. The pact neutralised the possibility of Soviet opposition to a campaign against Poland and assured that Germany would not have to face the prospect of a two-front war, as it had in World War I. Immediately after that, Hitler ordered the attack to proceed on 26 August, but upon hearing that the United Kingdom had concluded a formal mutual assistance pact with Poland and that Italy would maintain neutrality, he decided to delay it. In response to British requests for direct negotiations to avoid war, Germany made demands on Poland, which only served as a pretext to worsen relations. On 29 August, Hitler demanded that a Polish ||Plenipotentiary|| immediately travel to Berlin to negotiate the handover of ||Gda%C5%84sk||, and to allow a ||Referendum|| in the ||Polish_Corridor|| in which the German minority would vote on secession. The Poles refused to comply with the German demands, and on the night of 30–31 August in a confrontational meeting with the British ambassador ||Nevile_Henderson||, Ribbentrop declared that Germany considered its claims rejected.

The first German attack of the war came against the ||Battle_of_Westerplatte||. The United Kingdom responded with an ultimatum to Germany to cease military operations, and on 3 September, after the ultimatum was ignored, Britain and France declared war on Germany, followed by ||Australia||, ||Dominion_of_New_Zealand||, ||Union_of_South_Africa|| and ||Canada||. The alliance provided ||Phoney_War|| to Poland, outside of a ||Saar_Offensive||. The Western Allies also began a ||Blockade_of_Germany_(1939%E2%80%931945)||, which aimed to damage the country's economy and the war effort. Germany responded by ordering ||Submarine_warfare#World_War_II|| against Allied merchant and warships, which would later escalate into the ||Battle_of_the_Atlantic||.  Soldiers of the ||Polish_army_order_of_battle_in_1939|| during the ||Invasion_of_Poland||, September 1939 On 8 September, German troops reached the suburbs of ||Warsaw||.

On 6 October, Hitler made a public peace overture to the United Kingdom and France but said that the future of Poland was to be determined exclusively by Germany and the Soviet Union. The proposal was rejected, and Hitler ordered an immediate offensive against France, which was postponed until the spring of 1940 due to bad weather.  Finnish machine gun nest aimed at Soviet ||Red_Army|| positions during the ||Winter_War||, February 1940 After the outbreak of war in Poland, Stalin threatened ||Estonia||, ||Latvia|| and ||Lithuania|| with military invasion, forcing the three ||Baltic_states|| to sign ||Background_of_the_occupation_of_the_Baltic_states#Soviet_ultimatums_and_occupation|| that stipulated the creation of Soviet military bases in these countries.

In September 1940, Bulgaria demanded ||Southern_Dobruja|| from Romania with German and Italian support, leading to the ||Treaty_of_Craiova||. The loss of one-third of Romania's 1939 territory caused a coup against King Carol II, turning Romania into a fascist dictatorship under Marshal Ion Antonescu with a course set firmly towards the Axis in the hopes of a German guarantee. Meanwhile, Nazi-Soviet political rapprochement and economic co-operation gradually stalled, and both states began preparations for war.

The Germans carried out a flanking manoeuvre through the ||Ardennes|| region, which was mistakenly perceived by Allies as an impenetrable natural barrier against armoured vehicles.

In 1940, following the German capture of Paris, the size of the ||United_States_Navy|| was ||Two-Ocean_Navy_Act||. In September the United States further agreed to a ||Destroyers-for-bases_deal||. Still, a large majority of the American public continued to oppose any direct military intervention in the conflict well into 1941. In December 1940 Roosevelt accused Hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out any negotiations as useless, calling for the United States to become an "||Arsenal_of_Democracy||" and promoting ||Lend-Lease|| programmes of aid to support the British war effort. The United States started strategic planning to prepare for a full-scale offensive against Germany. At the end of September 1940, the ||Tripartite_Pact|| formally united Japan, Italy, and Germany as the ||Axis_powers||. The Tripartite Pact stipulated that any country, with the exception of the Soviet Union, which attacked any Axis Power would be forced to go to war against all three. The Axis expanded in November 1940 when ||Kingdom_of_Hungary_(1920%E2%80%931946)||, ||Slovak_Republic_(1939%E2%80%931945)|| and ||Kingdom_of_Romania|| joined. ||Romania_in_World_War_II|| and ||Hungary_in_World_War_II|| later made major contributions to the Axis war against the Soviet Union, in Romania's case partially to recapture ||Soviet_occupation_of_Bessarabia_and_northern_Bukovina||.

In October, ||Greco-Italian_War||, but the attack was repulsed with heavy Italian casualties; the campaign ended within months with minor territorial changes. Germany started preparation for an invasion of the Balkans to assist Italy, to prevent the British from gaining a foothold there, which would be a potential threat for Romanian oil fields, and to strike against the British dominance of the Mediterranean. In December 1940, British Empire forces began ||Operation_Compass|| against Italian forces in Egypt and ||East_African_campaign_(World_War_II)||. The offensives were highly successful; by early February 1941, Italy had lost control of eastern Libya, and large numbers of Italian troops had been taken prisoner. The ||Regia_Marina|| also suffered significant defeats, with the Royal Navy putting three Italian battleships out of commission by means of a ||Battle_of_Taranto||, and neutralising several more warships at the ||Battle_of_Cape_Matapan||.  German ||Panzer_III|| of the ||Afrika_Korps|| advancing across the North African desert, April-May 1941 Italian defeats prompted Germany to ||Operation_Sonnenblume|| to North Africa and at the end of March 1941, ||Erwin_Rommel||'s ||Afrika_Korps|| ||Western_Desert_campaign|| which drove back the Commonwealth forces. In under a month, Axis forces advanced to western Egypt and ||Siege_of_Tobruk||. By late March 1941, ||Bulgaria|| and ||Yugoslavia|| signed the ||Tripartite_Pact||; however, the Yugoslav government was ||Yugoslav_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat|| by pro-British nationalists. Germany responded with simultaneous invasions of both ||Invasion_of_Yugoslavia|| and ||Battle_of_Greece||, commencing on 6 April 1941; both nations were forced to surrender within the month. The airborne ||Battle_of_Crete|| at the end of May completed the German conquest of the Balkans.

With the Soviets wary of mounting tensions with Germany and the Japanese planning to take advantage of the European War by seizing resource-rich European possessions in ||Southeast_Asia||, the two powers signed the ||Soviet%E2%80%93Japanese_Neutrality_Pact|| in April 1941. By contrast, the Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the Soviet Union, massing forces on the Soviet border. Hitler believed that the United Kingdom's refusal to end the war was based on the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union would enter the war against Germany sooner or later. On 31 July 1940 Hitler decided that the Soviet Union should be eliminated and aimed for the conquest of ||Ukrainian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic||, the ||Baltic_states|| and ||Byelorussian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic||. However, other senior German officials like Ribbentrop saw an opportunity to create a Euro-Asian bloc against the British Empire by inviting the Soviet Union into the Tripartite Pact. In November 1940, ||German%E2%80%93Soviet_Axis_talks|| to determine if the Soviet Union would join the pact. The Soviets showed some interest but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable. On 18 December 1940, Hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet Union.  German soldiers during the invasion of the Soviet Union by the ||Axis_powers||, 1941 On 22 June 1941, Germany, supported by Italy and Romania, invaded the Soviet Union in ||Operation_Barbarossa||, with Germany accusing the Soviets of plotting against them. They were joined shortly by Finland and Hungary. The primary targets of this surprise offensive were the ||Baltic_region||, Moscow and Ukraine, with the ||Strategic_goal_(military)|| of ending the 1941 campaign near the ||A-A_line||, from the ||Caspian_Sea|| to the ||White_Sea||. Hitler's objectives were to eliminate the Soviet Union as a military power, exterminate Communism, generate ||Lebensraum|| ("living space") by ||Generalplan_Ost|| and guarantee access to the strategic resources needed to defeat Germany's remaining rivals. Although the ||Red_Army|| was preparing for strategic ||Counter-offensive|| before the war, Operation Barbarossa forced the ||Stavka|| to adopt a ||Strategic_defence||. During the summer, the Axis made significant gains into Soviet territory, inflicting immense losses in both personnel and materiel. By mid-August, however, the German ||Oberkommando_des_Heeres|| decided to ||Battle_of_Smolensk_(1941)|| of a considerably depleted ||Army_Group_Centre||, and to divert the ||2nd_Panzer_Army|| to reinforce troops advancing towards central Ukraine and Leningrad. The ||Battle_of_Kiev_(1941)|| was overwhelmingly successful, resulting in encirclement and elimination of four Soviet armies, and made possible further ||Crimean_campaign|| and industrially developed Eastern Ukraine (the ||First_Battle_of_Kharkov||).  Soviet civilians leaving destroyed houses after a German bombardment during the ||Battle_of_Leningrad||, 10 December 1942 The diversion of three quarters of the Axis troops and the majority of their air forces from France and the central Mediterranean to the ||Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)|| prompted the United Kingdom to reconsider its ||Grand_strategy||. In July, the UK and the Soviet Union formed a ||Anglo-Soviet_Agreement|| and in August, the United Kingdom and the United States jointly issued the ||Atlantic_Charter||, which outlined British and American goals for the post-war world. In late August the British and Soviets ||Anglo-Soviet_invasion_of_Iran|| to secure the ||Persian_Corridor||, Iran's ||Petroleum_reservoir#Oil_field||, and preempt any Axis advances through Iran toward the Baku oil fields or British India. By October Axis ||Operational_objective|| in Ukraine and the Baltic region were achieved, with only the sieges of ||Siege_of_Leningrad|| and ||Siege_of_Sevastopol_(1941%E2%80%931942)|| continuing. A major ||Battle_of_Moscow|| was renewed; after two months of fierce battles in increasingly harsh weather, the German army almost reached the outer suburbs of Moscow, where the exhausted troops were forced to suspend their offensive. Large territorial gains were made by Axis forces, but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives: two key cities remained in Soviet hands, the Soviet ||Military_capability|| was not broken, and the Soviet Union retained a considerable part of its military potential. The blitzkrieg ||Phase_(combat)|| of the war in Europe had ended. By early December, freshly mobilised ||Military_reserve_force|| allowed the Soviets to achieve numerical parity with Axis troops. This, as well as ||Richard_Sorge#Wartime_intelligence|| which established that a minimal number of Soviet troops in the East would be sufficient to deter any attack by the Japanese ||Kwantung_Army||, allowed the Soviets to begin a ||Winter_campaign_of_1941%E2%80%9342|| that started on 5 December all along the front and pushed German troops 100–250 kilometres (62–155 mi) west. War breaks out in the Pacific (1941) Main article: ||Pacific_War|| Following the Japanese ||False_flag|| ||Mukden_Incident|| in 1931, the Japanese shelling of the American ||USS_Panay_incident|| in 1937, and the 1937–38 ||Nanjing_Massacre||, ||Japan%E2%80%93United_States_relations#1937–1941||. In 1939, the United States notified Japan that it would not be extending its trade treaty and American public opinion opposing Japanese expansionism led to a series of economic sanctions, the ||Export_Control_Act||, which banned U.S. exports of chemicals, minerals and military parts to Japan and increased economic pressure on the Japanese regime. During 1939 Japan launched its ||Battle_of_Changsha_(1939)||, a strategically important Chinese city, but was repulsed by late September. Despite ||1939%E2%80%9340_Winter_Offensive|| by both sides, the war between China and Japan was stalemated by 1940. To increase pressure on China by blocking supply routes, and to better position Japanese forces in the event of a war with the Western powers, Japan invaded and ||Japanese_invasion_of_French_Indochina|| in September 1940.  Japanese soldiers ||Battle_of_Hong_Kong||, 8 December 1941 Chinese nationalist forces launched a large-scale ||1939%E2%80%9340_Winter_Offensive|| in early 1940.

The continued antipathy between Chinese communist and nationalist forces ||New_Fourth_Army_incident||, effectively ending their co-operation. In March, the Japanese 11th army attacked the headquarters of the Chinese 19th army but was repulsed during ||Battle_of_Shanggao||. In September, Japan attempted to ||Battle_of_Changsha_(1941)|| again and clashed with Chinese nationalist forces. German successes in Europe encouraged Japan to increase pressure on European governments in ||Southeast_Asia||. The Dutch government agreed to provide Japan with some oil supplies from the ||Dutch_East_Indies||, but negotiations for additional access to their resources ended in failure in June 1941. In July 1941 Japan sent troops to southern Indochina, thus threatening British and Dutch possessions in the Far East. The United States, the United Kingdom, and other Western governments reacted to this move with a freeze on Japanese assets and a total oil embargo. At the same time, Japan was ||Kantokuen||, intending to capitalise off the German invasion in the west, but abandoned the operation after the sanctions. Since early 1941 the United States and Japan had been engaged in negotiations in an attempt to improve their strained relations and end the war in China. During these negotiations, Japan advanced a number of proposals which were dismissed by the Americans as inadequate. At the same time the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands engaged in secret discussions for the joint defence of their territories, in the event of a Japanese attack against any of them. Roosevelt reinforced ||Commonwealth_of_the_Philippines|| and warned Japan that the United States would react to Japanese attacks against any "neighboring countries".  The ||USS_Arizona_(BB-39)|| was a total loss in the ||Japanese_attack_on_Pearl_Harbor|| on the ||United_States_Pacific_Fleet|| at ||Pearl_Harbor||, Sunday 7 December 1941. Frustrated at the lack of progress and feeling the pinch of the American–British–Dutch sanctions, Japan prepared for war. On 20 November, a new government under ||Hideki_Tojo|| presented an interim proposal as its final offer. It called for the end of American aid to China and for lifting the embargo on the supply of oil and other resources to Japan. In exchange, Japan promised not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia and to withdraw its forces from southern Indochina. The American counter-proposal of 26 November required that Japan evacuate all of China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with all Pacific powers. That meant Japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in China, or seizing the natural resources it needed in the Dutch East Indies by force; the Japanese military did not consider the former an option, and many officers considered the oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war. Japan planned to seize European colonies in Asia to create a large defensive perimeter stretching into the Central Pacific. The Japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of Southeast Asia while exhausting the over-stretched Allies by fighting a defensive war. To prevent American intervention while securing the perimeter, it was further planned to neutralise the ||United_States_Pacific_Fleet|| and the American military presence in the Philippines from the outset. On 7 December 1941 (8 December in Asian time zones), Japan attacked British and American holdings with near-simultaneous ||Pacific_War#Japanese_offensives,_1941–42||. These included an ||Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor|| and ||Philippines_campaign_(1941%E2%80%931942)||, ||Battle_of_Guam_(1941)||, ||Battle_of_Wake_Island||, ||Malayan_campaign||, ||Japanese_invasion_of_Thailand|| and the ||Battle_of_Hong_Kong||. The Japanese invasion of Thailand led to Thailand's decision to ally itself with Japan and the other Japanese attacks led the ||United_States_declaration_of_war_on_Japan||, ||United_Kingdom_declaration_of_war_on_Japan||, China, Australia, and several other states to formally declare war on Japan, whereas the Soviet Union, being heavily involved in large-scale hostilities with European Axis countries, maintained its neutrality agreement with Japan. Germany, followed by the other Axis states, declared war on the United States in solidarity with Japan, citing as justification the American attacks on German war vessels that had been ordered by Roosevelt. Axis advance stalls (1942–43)  US President ||Franklin_D._Roosevelt|| and British PM ||Winston_Churchill|| seated at the ||Casablanca_Conference||, January 1943 On 1 January 1942, the ||Four_Policemen||—the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom and the United States—and 22 smaller or exiled governments issued the ||Declaration_by_United_Nations||, thereby affirming the ||Atlantic_Charter||, and agreeing not to sign a ||Separate_peace|| with the Axis powers. During 1942, Allied officials debated on the appropriate ||Grand_strategy|| to pursue. All agreed that ||Europe_first|| was the primary objective. The Americans favoured a straightforward, ||Operation_Sledgehammer|| on Germany through France. The Soviets were also demanding a second front. The British, on the other hand, argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out German strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolster resistance forces. Germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing campaign. An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour without using large-scale armies. Eventually, the British persuaded the Americans that a landing in France was infeasible in 1942 and they should instead focus on driving the Axis out of North Africa. At the ||Casablanca_Conference|| in early 1943, the Allies reiterated the statements issued in the 1942 Declaration and demanded the ||Unconditional_surrender|| of their enemies. The British and Americans agreed to continue to press the initiative in the Mediterranean by invading Sicily to fully secure the Mediterranean supply routes. Although the British argued for further operations in the Balkans to bring Turkey into the war, in May 1943, the Americans extracted a British commitment to limit Allied operations in the Mediterranean to an invasion of the Italian mainland and to invade France in 1944. Pacific (1942–43)  Map of Japanese military advances through mid-1942 By the end of April 1942, Japan and its ally ||Thailand_in_World_War_II|| had almost fully conquered ||Japanese_invasion_of_Burma||, ||Malayan_campaign||, ||Dutch_East_Indies_campaign||, ||Battle_of_Singapore||, and ||Battle_of_Rabaul_(1942)||, inflicting severe losses on Allied troops and taking a large number of prisoners. Despite stubborn ||Philippines_campaign_(1941%E2%80%931942)||, the ||Commonwealth_of_the_Philippines|| was eventually captured in May 1942, forcing its government into exile. On 16 April, in Burma, 7,000 British soldiers were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the ||Battle_of_Yenangyaung|| and rescued by the Chinese 38th Division. Japanese forces also achieved naval victories in the ||Sinking_of_Prince_of_Wales_and_Repulse||, ||Battle_of_the_Java_Sea|| and ||Indian_Ocean_raid||, and ||Bombing_of_Darwin|| at ||Darwin,_Northern_Territory||, Australia. In January 1942, the only Allied success against Japan was a Chinese ||Battle_of_Changsha_(1941%E2%80%9342)||. These easy victories over the unprepared US and European opponents left Japan overconfident, as well as overextended. In early May 1942, Japan initiated operations to ||Operation_Mo|| by ||Amphibious_warfare|| and thus sever communications and supply lines between the United States and Australia. The planned invasion was thwarted when an Allied task force, centred on two American fleet carriers, fought Japanese naval forces to a draw in the ||Battle_of_the_Coral_Sea||. Japan's next plan, motivated by the earlier ||Doolittle_Raid||, was to seize ||Midway_Atoll|| and lure American carriers into battle to be eliminated; as a diversion, Japan would also send forces to ||Aleutian_Islands_campaign|| in Alaska. In mid-May, Japan started the ||Zhejiang-Jiangxi_campaign|| in China, with the goal of inflicting retribution on the Chinese who aided the surviving American airmen in the Doolittle Raid by destroying Chinese air bases and fighting against the Chinese 23rd and 32nd Army Groups. In early June, Japan put its operations into action, but the Americans, having broken ||Japanese_naval_codes|| in late May, were fully aware of the plans and order of battle, and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive ||Battle_of_Midway|| over the ||Imperial_Japanese_Navy||.  ||United_States_Marine_Corps|| during the ||Guadalcanal_Campaign||, in the ||Pacific_Ocean_theater_of_World_War_II||, 1942 With its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the Midway battle, Japan chose to focus on a belated attempt to capture ||Port_Moresby|| by an ||Kokoda_Track_campaign|| in the ||Territory_of_Papua||. The Americans planned a counter-attack against Japanese positions in the southern ||Solomon_Islands||, primarily ||Guadalcanal||, as a first step towards capturing ||Rabaul||, the main Japanese base in Southeast Asia. Both plans started in July, but by mid-September, ||Guadalcanal_campaign|| took priority for the Japanese, and troops in New Guinea were ordered to withdraw from the Port Moresby area to the ||Oro_Province||, where they faced Australian and United States troops in the ||Battle_of_Buna%E2%80%93Gona||. Guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for Guadalcanal. By the start of 1943, the Japanese were defeated on the island and ||Operation_Ke||. In Burma, Commonwealth forces mounted two operations. The first, ||Arakan_Campaign_1942%E2%80%9343|| in late 1942, went disastrously, forcing a retreat back to India by May 1943. The second was the ||Chindits#Operation_Longcloth|| behind Japanese front-lines in February which, by the end of April, had achieved mixed results. Eastern Front (1942–43)  ||Red_Army|| soldiers on the counterattack during the ||Battle_of_Stalingrad||, February 1943 Despite considerable losses, in early 1942 Germany and its allies stopped a major Soviet offensive in central and southern Russia, keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year. In May, the Germans defeated Soviet offensives in the ||Battle_of_the_Kerch_Peninsula|| and at ||Second_Battle_of_Kharkov||, and then launched their main ||Case_Blue|| against southern Russia in June 1942, to seize the ||Petroleum_industry_in_Azerbaijan|| and occupy the ||Kuban|| ||Steppe||, while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front. The Germans split ||Army_Group_South|| into two groups: ||Army_Group_A|| advanced to the lower ||Don_(river)|| and struck south-east to the Caucasus, while ||Army_Group_B|| headed towards the ||Volga||. The Soviets decided to make their stand at Stalingrad on the Volga. By mid-November, the Germans had ||Battle_of_Stalingrad|| in bitter ||Urban_warfare||. The Soviets began their second winter counter-offensive, starting with an ||Operation_Uranus||, and an assault on the ||Operation_Mars||, though the latter failed disastrously. By early February 1943, the German Army had taken tremendous losses; German troops at Stalingrad had been defeated, and the front-line had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive. In mid-February, after the Soviet push had tapered off, the Germans launched another ||Third_Battle_of_Kharkov||, creating a ||Salient_(military)|| in their front line around the Soviet city of ||Kursk||.

By November 1941, Commonwealth forces had launched a counter-offensive, ||Operation_Crusader||, in North Africa, and reclaimed all the gains the Germans and Italians had made. In North Africa, the Germans launched an offensive in January, pushing the British back to positions at the ||Battle_of_Gazala#Gazala_line|| by early February, followed by a temporary lull in combat which Germany used to prepare for their upcoming offensives. Concerns the Japanese might use bases in ||French_Madagascar|| caused the British to ||Battle_of_Madagascar|| in early May 1942. An Axis ||Battle_of_Gazala|| forced an Allied retreat deep inside Egypt until Axis forces were ||First_Battle_of_El_Alamein||. On the Continent, raids of Allied ||Commando|| on strategic targets, culminating in the disastrous ||Dieppe_Raid||, demonstrated the Western Allies' inability to launch an invasion of continental Europe without much better preparation, equipment, and operational security. In August 1942, the Allies succeeded in repelling a ||Battle_of_Alam_el_Halfa|| and, at a high cost, managed to ||Operation_Pedestal||. A few months later, the Allies ||Second_Battle_of_El_Alamein|| in Egypt, dislodging the Axis forces and beginning a drive west across Libya. This attack was followed up shortly after by ||Operation_Torch||, which resulted in the region joining the Allies. Hitler responded to the French colony's defection by ordering the ||Case_Anton||; although Vichy forces did not resist this violation of the armistice, they managed to ||Scuttling_of_the_French_fleet_at_Toulon|| to prevent its capture by German forces. The Axis forces in Africa withdrew into ||Tunisia||, which was ||Tunisian_campaign|| in May 1943. In June 1943 the British and Americans began ||Combined_Bomber_Offensive|| against Germany with a goal to disrupt the war economy, reduce morale, and "||Dehousing||" the civilian population. The ||Bombing_of_Hamburg_in_World_War_II|| was among the first attacks in this campaign, inflicting significant casualties and considerable losses on infrastructure of this important industrial centre. Allies gain momentum (1943–44)  ||United_States_Navy|| ||Douglas_SBD_Dauntless|| ||Scout_plane|| flying patrol over ||USS_Washington_(BB-56)|| and ||USS_Lexington_(CV-16)|| during the ||Gilbert_and_Marshall_Islands_campaign||, 1943 After the Guadalcanal Campaign, the Allies initiated several operations against Japan in the Pacific. In May 1943, Canadian and US forces were sent to ||Aleutian_Islands_campaign#Allied_response||. Soon after, the United States, with support from Australia, New Zealand and Pacific Islander forces, began major ground, sea and air operations to ||Operation_Cartwheel||, and ||Gilbert_and_Marshall_Islands_campaign||. By the end of March 1944, the Allies had completed both of these objectives and had also ||Operation_Hailstone|| in the ||Caroline_Islands||. In April, the Allies launched an operation to ||Western_New_Guinea_campaign||. In the Soviet Union, both the Germans and the Soviets spent the spring and early summer of 1943 preparing for large offensives in central Russia. On 5 July 1943, Germany ||Battle_of_Kursk||. Within a week, German forces had exhausted themselves against the Soviets' deeply echeloned and well-constructed defences, and for the first time in the war, Hitler cancelled an operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success. This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies' ||Allied_invasion_of_Sicily|| launched on 9 July, which, combined with previous Italian failures, resulted in the ||Fall_of_the_Fascist_regime_in_Italy|| later that month.  ||Red_Army|| troops in a counter-offensive on German positions at the ||Battle_of_Kursk||, July 1943 On 12 July 1943, the Soviets launched their own ||Operation_Kutuzov||, thereby dispelling any chance of German victory or even stalemate in the east. The Soviet victory at Kursk marked the end of German superiority, giving the Soviet Union the initiative on the Eastern Front. The Germans tried to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified ||Panther%E2%80%93Wotan_line||, but the Soviets broke through it at ||Battle_of_Smolensk_(1943)|| and by the ||Battle_of_the_Dnieper||. On 3 September 1943, the Western Allies ||Allied_invasion_of_Italy||, following ||Armistice_of_Cassibile||. Germany, with the help of fascists, responded by ||Operation_Achse|| that were in many places without superior orders, seizing military control of Italian areas, and creating a series of defensive lines. German special forces then ||Gran_Sasso_raid||, who then soon established a new client state in German-occupied Italy named the ||Italian_Social_Republic||, causing an ||Italian_Civil_War||. The Western Allies fought through several lines until reaching the ||Winter_Line|| in mid-November. German operations in the Atlantic also suffered. By ||Black_May_(1943)||, the resulting sizeable German submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the German Atlantic naval campaign. In November 1943, ||Franklin_D._Roosevelt|| and Winston Churchill met with ||Chiang_Kai-shek|| ||Cairo_Conference|| and then with Joseph Stalin ||Tehran_Conference||. The former conference determined the post-war return of Japanese territory and the military planning for the ||Burma_campaign||, while the latter included agreement that the Western Allies would invade Europe in 1944 and that the Soviet Union would declare war on Japan within three months of Germany's defeat.  Ruins of the ||Monte_Cassino|| monastery, during the ||Battle_of_Monte_Cassino||, ||Italian_Campaign_(World_War_II)||, May 1944 From November 1943, during the seven-week ||Battle_of_Changde||, the Chinese forced Japan to fight a costly war of attrition, while awaiting Allied relief. In January 1944, the Allies launched a ||Battle_of_Monte_Cassino|| and tried to outflank it with ||Battle_of_Anzio||. On 27 January 1944, ||Leningrad_Front|| troops launched ||Siege_of_Leningrad#Soviet_relief_of_the_siege|| that expelled German forces from the ||Leningrad_Oblast||, thereby ending the ||List_of_battles_by_casualties#Sieges_and_urban_combat||. The ||Leningrad%E2%80%93Novgorod_Offensive|| was ||Battle_of_Narva_(1944)|| by the German ||Army_Group_North|| aided by ||German_occupation_of_Estonia_during_World_War_II#Estonians_in_Nazi_German_military_units|| hoping to ||Estonian_government-in-exile#Failure_to_reestablish_independence||. This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the ||Baltic_Sea|| region. By late May 1944, the Soviets had ||Crimean_Offensive||, ||Dnieper%E2%80%93Carpathian_Offensive||, and made ||First_Jassy%E2%80%93Kishinev_Offensive||, which were repulsed by the Axis troops. The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, on 4 June Rome was captured. The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, ||Operation_U-Go||, and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at ||Battle_of_Imphal|| and ||Battle_of_Kohima||. In May 1944, British forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma by July, and Chinese forces that had ||Battle_of_Northern_Burma_and_Western_Yunnan|| in late 1943 ||Siege_of_Myitkyina|| in ||Myitkyina||. The ||Operation_Ichi-Go|| of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting forces, secure railways between Japanese-held territory and capture Allied airfields. By June, the Japanese had conquered the province of ||Henan|| and begun a ||Battle_of_Changsha_(1944)||. Allies close in (1944)  American troops approaching ||Omaha_Beach|| during the ||Operation_Overlord|| on ||Normandy_landings||, 6 June 1944 On 6 June 1944 (known as ||Normandy_landings||), after three years of Soviet pressure, the Western Allies ||Operation_Overlord||. After reassigning several Allied divisions from Italy, they also ||Operation_Dragoon||. These landings were successful and led to the defeat of the ||Falaise_Pocket||. ||Paris|| was ||Liberation_of_Paris|| on 25 August by the ||French_Resistance|| assisted by the ||Free_French_Forces||, both led by General ||Charles_de_Gaulle||, and the Western Allies continued to ||Allied_advance_from_Paris_to_the_Rhine|| in western Europe during the latter part of the year. An attempt to advance into northern Germany spearheaded by ||Operation_Market_Garden|| in the Netherlands failed. After that, the Western Allies slowly pushed into Germany, but ||Operation_Queen|| in a large offensive. In Italy, Allied advance also slowed due to the ||Gothic_Line||.  German ||Schutzstaffel|| soldiers from the ||Dirlewanger_Brigade||, tasked with suppressing the ||Warsaw_Uprising|| against Nazi occupation, August 1944 On 22 June, the Soviets launched a strategic offensive in Belarus ("||Operation_Bagration||") that almost completely destroyed the German ||Army_Group_Centre||. Soon after that, ||Lvov%E2%80%93Sandomierz_Offensive|| forced German troops from Western Ukraine and Eastern Poland. The Soviets formed the ||Polish_Committee_of_National_Liberation|| to control territory in Poland and combat the Polish ||Home_Army||; The Soviet Red Army remained in the ||Praga|| district on the other side of the ||Vistula|| and watched passively as the Germans quelled the ||Warsaw_Uprising|| initiated by the Armia Krajowa. The ||Slovak_National_Uprising|| in ||Slovak_Republic_(1939%E2%80%931945)|| was also quelled by the Germans. The Soviet ||Red_Army||'s ||Second_Jassy%E2%80%93Kishinev_Offensive|| cut off and destroyed the ||Army_Group_South_Ukraine|| and triggered ||King_Michael%27s_Coup|| and ||1944_Bulgarian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat||, followed by those countries' shift to the Allied side. In September 1944, Soviet troops advanced into ||Democratic_Federal_Yugoslavia|| and forced the rapid withdrawal of German Army Groups ||Army_Group_E|| and ||Army_Group_F|| in ||Axis_occupation_of_Greece||, ||German_occupation_of_Albania|| and Yugoslavia to rescue them from being cut off. By this point, the Communist-led ||Yugoslav_Partisans|| under Marshal ||Josip_Broz_Tito||, who had led an ||World_War_II_in_Yugoslavia|| against the occupation since 1941, controlled much of the territory of Yugoslavia and engaged in delaying efforts against German forces further south. In northern ||Territory_of_the_Military_Commander_in_Serbia||, the Soviet ||Red_Army||, with limited support from Bulgarian forces, assisted the Partisans in a joint ||Belgrade_Offensive|| on 20 October. A few days later, the Soviets launched a ||Budapest_Offensive|| against ||Operation_Panzerfaust|| Hungary that lasted until ||Siege_of_Budapest|| in February 1945. Unlike impressive Soviet victories in the Balkans, ||Continuation_War|| to the ||Vyborg%E2%80%93Petrozavodsk_Offensive|| in the ||Karelian_Isthmus|| denied the Soviets occupation of Finland and led to a ||Moscow_Armistice|| on relatively mild conditions, although Finland was forced to ||Lapland_War||.  ||General_(United_States)|| ||Douglas_MacArthur|| returns to the ||Commonwealth_of_the_Philippines|| during the ||Battle_of_Leyte||, 20 October 1944 By the start of July 1944, Commonwealth forces in Southeast Asia had repelled the Japanese sieges in ||Assam||, pushing the Japanese back to the ||Chindwin_River|| while the Chinese captured Myitkyina. In September 1944, Chinese forces ||Battle_of_Mount_Song|| and reopened the ||Burma_Road||. In China, the Japanese had more successes, having finally ||Battle_of_Changsha_(1944)#Battle_of_Changsha|| in mid-June and the city of ||Defense_of_Hengyang|| by early August. Soon after, they invaded the province of ||Guangxi||, winning major engagements against Chinese forces at ||Battle_of_Guilin%E2%80%93Liuzhou|| by the end of November and successfully linking up their forces in China and Indochina by mid-December. In the Pacific, US forces continued to press back the Japanese perimeter. In mid-June 1944, they began their ||Mariana_and_Palau_Islands_campaign|| and decisively defeated Japanese forces in the ||Battle_of_the_Philippine_Sea||. These defeats led to the resignation of the Japanese Prime Minister, ||Hideki_Tojo||, and provided the United States with air bases to launch intensive heavy bomber attacks on the Japanese home islands. In late October, American forces ||Battle_of_Leyte||; soon after, Allied naval forces scored another large victory in the ||Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf||, one of the largest naval battles in history. Axis collapse, Allied victory (1944–45)  ||Yalta_Conference|| held in February 1945, with ||Winston_Churchill||, ||Franklin_D._Roosevelt|| and ||Joseph_Stalin|| On 16 December 1944, Germany made a last attempt on the Western Front by using most of its remaining reserves to launch ||Battle_of_the_Bulge|| and ||Operation_Nordwind|| to split the Western Allies, encircle large portions of Western Allied troops and capture their primary supply port at ||Antwerp|| to prompt a political settlement. By 16 January 1945, the offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled. In Italy, the Western Allies remained stalemated at the German defensive line. In mid-January 1945, the Red Army attacked in Poland, ||Vistula%E2%80%93Oder_Offensive|| river in Germany, and ||East_Prussian_Offensive||. On 4 February Soviet, British, and US leaders met for the ||Yalta_Conference||. They agreed on the occupation of post-war Germany, and on when the Soviet Union would join the war against Japan. In February, the Soviets ||Silesian_Offensives|| and ||East_Pomeranian_Offensive||, while ||Western_Allied_invasion_of_Germany|| and closed to the ||Rhine|| river. By March, the Western Allies crossed the Rhine ||Operation_Plunder|| and ||Remagen|| of the ||Rhine-Ruhr||, ||Ruhr_Pocket||. In early March, in an attempt to protect its last oil reserves in Hungary and to retake Budapest, Germany launched ||Operation_Spring_Awakening|| against Soviet troops near ||Lake_Balaton||. In two weeks, the offensive had been repulsed, the Soviets advanced to ||Vienna_offensive||, and captured the city. In early April, Soviet troops ||Battle_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg||, while the Western Allies finally ||Spring_1945_offensive_in_Italy|| and swept across western Germany capturing ||Battle_of_Hamburg_(1945)|| and ||Battle_of_Nuremberg_(1945)||. ||Elbe_Day|| on 25 April, leaving several unoccupied pockets in southern Germany and around Berlin.

In the Pacific theatre, American forces accompanied by the forces of the ||Philippine_Commonwealth|| advanced ||Philippines_campaign_(1944%E2%80%931945)||, ||Battle_of_Leyte|| by the end of April 1945. They ||Battle_of_Luzon|| in January 1945 and ||Battle_of_Manila_(1945)|| in March. Fighting continued on Luzon, ||Battle_of_Mindanao||, and other islands of the Philippines until the ||End_of_World_War_II_in_Asia||. Meanwhile, the ||United_States_Army_Air_Forces|| launched ||Air_raids_on_Japan|| of strategic cities in Japan in an effort to destroy Japanese war industry and civilian morale. A devastating ||Bombing_of_Tokyo|| was the deadliest conventional bombing raid in history.  ||Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki|| of ||Nagasaki|| on 9 August 1945. In May 1945, Australian troops ||Borneo_campaign||, overrunning the oilfields there. British, American, and Chinese forces defeated the Japanese in northern ||Burma_campaign|| in March, and the British pushed on to reach ||Yangon|| by 3 May. Chinese forces started a counterattack in the ||Battle_of_West_Hunan|| that occurred between 6 April and 7 June 1945. American naval and amphibious forces also moved towards Japan, taking ||Battle_of_Iwo_Jima|| by March, and ||Battle_of_Okinawa|| by the end of June. At the same time, American submarines ||Allied_submarines_in_the_Pacific_War|| Japanese imports, drastically reducing Japan's ability to supply its overseas forces. On 11 July, Allied leaders ||Potsdam_Conference||. They ||Potsdam_Agreement|| about Germany, and the American, British and Chinese governments reiterated the demand for unconditional surrender of Japan, specifically stating that ||Potsdam_Declaration||. During this conference, the United Kingdom ||1945_United_Kingdom_general_election||, and ||Clement_Attlee|| replaced Churchill as Prime Minister. The call for unconditional surrender was rejected by the Japanese government, which believed it would be capable of negotiating for more favourable surrender terms. In early August, the United States ||Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki|| on the Japanese cities of ||Hiroshima|| and ||Nagasaki||. Between the two bombings, the Soviets, pursuant to the Yalta agreement, ||Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria|| and quickly defeated the ||Kwantung_Army||, which was the largest Japanese fighting force. These two events persuaded previously adamant Imperial Army leaders to accept surrender terms. The Red Army also captured the ||Soviet_Invasion_of_South_Sakhalin|| and the ||Invasion_of_the_Kuril_Islands||. On 15 August 1945, ||Surrender_of_Japan||, with the ||Japanese_Instrument_of_Surrender|| finally signed at ||Tokyo_Bay|| on the deck of the American battleship ||USS_Missouri_(BB-63)|| on 2 September 1945, ending the war. Aftermath Main articles: ||Aftermath_of_World_War_II|| and ||Consequences_of_Nazism||  Ruins of ||Warsaw|| in 1945, after the ||Planned_destruction_of_Warsaw|| by the occupying German forces The Allies established occupation administrations in ||Allied-occupied_Austria|| and ||Allied-occupied_Germany||. The former became a neutral state, non-aligned with any political bloc. The latter was divided into western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union. A ||Denazification|| programme in Germany led to the prosecution of Nazi war criminals in the ||Nuremberg_trials|| and the removal of ex-Nazis from power, although this policy moved towards amnesty and re-integration of ex-Nazis into West German society. Germany lost a quarter of its pre-war (1937) territory. Among the eastern territories, ||Silesia||, ||Neumark|| and most of ||Pomerania|| were taken over by Poland, and ||East_Prussia|| was divided between Poland and the Soviet Union, followed by the ||Flight_and_expulsion_of_Germans_(1944%E2%80%9350)|| of the nine million Germans from these provinces, as well as three million Germans from the ||Sudetenland|| in Czechoslovakia. By the 1950s, one-fifth of West Germans were refugees from the east. The Soviet Union also took over the Polish provinces east of the ||Curzon_line||, from which ||Polish_population_transfers_(1944%E2%80%931946)||; north-east Romania, parts of eastern Finland, and the three ||Baltic_states|| were ||Soviet_occupation_of_the_Baltic_states_(1944)||.  Defendants at the ||Nuremberg_trials||, where the Allied forces prosecuted prominent members of the political, military, judicial and economic leadership of ||Nazi_Germany|| for ||Crimes_against_humanity|| In an effort to maintain ||World_peace||, the Allies formed the ||United_Nations||, which officially came into existence on 24 October 1945, and adopted the ||Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights|| in 1948 as a common standard for all ||Member_states_of_the_United_Nations||. The great powers that were the victors of the war—France, China, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and the United States—became the ||Permanent_members_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council|| of the UN's ||United_Nations_Security_Council||. The five permanent members remain so to the present, although there have been two seat changes, ||United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_2758|| the ||Taiwan|| and the ||China|| in 1971, and between the Soviet Union and its ||Successor_state||, the ||Russia||, following the ||Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union|| in 1991. The alliance between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union had begun to deteriorate even before the war was over.  Post-war border changes in ||Central_Europe|| and creation of the ||Communism|| ||Eastern_Bloc|| Germany had been de facto divided, and two independent states, the ||West_Germany|| (West Germany) and the ||East_Germany|| (East Germany), were created within the borders of ||Bizone|| and ||Soviet_occupation_zone||. The rest of Europe was also divided into Western and Soviet ||Spheres_of_influence||. Most eastern and central European countries fell into ||Eastern_Bloc||, which led to establishment of Communist-led regimes, with full or partial support of the Soviet occupation authorities. As a result, ||East_Germany||, ||Polish_People%27s_Republic||, ||Hungarian_People%27s_Republic||, ||Socialist_Republic_of_Romania||, ||Czechoslovak_Socialist_Republic||, and ||People%27s_Socialist_Republic_of_Albania|| became Soviet ||Satellite_state||. Communist ||Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia|| conducted a fully ||Non-Aligned_Movement||, causing ||Tito%E2%80%93Stalin_Split||. Post-war division of the world was formalised by two international military alliances, the United States-led ||NATO|| and the Soviet-led ||Warsaw_Pact||. The long period of political tensions and military competition between them, the ||Cold_War||, would be accompanied by an unprecedented ||Arms_race|| and number of ||Proxy_war|| throughout the world. In Asia, the United States led the ||Occupation_of_Japan|| and ||Trust_Territory_of_the_Pacific_Islands|| in the Western Pacific, while the Soviets annexed ||South_Sakhalin|| and the ||Kuril_Islands||. ||Korea||, formerly ||Korea_under_Japanese_rule||, was ||Division_of_Korea|| by the Soviet Union in the ||North_Korea|| and the United States in the ||South_Korea|| between 1945 and 1948. Separate republics emerged on both sides of the 38th parallel in 1948, each claiming to be the legitimate government for all of Korea, which led ultimately to the ||Korean_War||.  ||David_Ben-Gurion|| proclaiming the ||Israeli_Declaration_of_Independence|| at the ||Independence_Hall_(Israel)||, 14 May 1948 In China, nationalist and communist forces resumed ||Chinese_Civil_War|| in June 1946. Communist forces were victorious and established the People's Republic of China on the mainland, while nationalist forces retreated to ||Taiwan|| in 1949. In the Middle East, the Arab rejection of the ||United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine|| and the ||Creation_of_Israel|| marked the escalation of the ||Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_conflict||. While European powers attempted to retain some or all of their ||Colonial_empire||, their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful, leading to ||Decolonization||. The global economy suffered heavily from the war, although participating nations were affected differently. The United States emerged much richer than any other nation, leading to a ||Post%E2%80%93World_War_II_baby_boom||, and by 1950 its gross domestic product per person was much higher than that of any of the other powers, and it dominated the world economy. The UK and US pursued a policy of ||Allied_plans_for_German_industry_after_World_War_II|| in the years 1945–1948. Because of international trade interdependencies this led to European economic stagnation and delayed European recovery for several years. Recovery began with the mid-1948 ||Deutsche_Mark||, and was sped up by the liberalisation of European economic policy that the ||Marshall_Plan|| (1948–1951) both directly and indirectly caused. The post-1948 West German recovery has been called the ||Wirtschaftswunder#West_Germany||. Italy also experienced an ||Italian_economic_miracle|| and the ||Trente_Glorieuses||. By contrast, the United Kingdom was in a state of economic ruin, and although receiving a quarter of the total Marshall Plan assistance, more than any other European country, it continued in relative economic decline for decades. The Soviet Union, despite enormous human and material losses, also experienced rapid increase in production in the immediate post-war era. Japan recovered much later. China returned to its pre-war industrial production by 1952. Impact Main article: ||Historiography_of_World_War_II|| Casualties and war crimes Main articles: ||World_War_II_casualties|| and ||List_of_war_crimes_committed_during_World_War_II||  World War II deaths Estimates for the total number of casualties in the war vary, because many deaths went unrecorded. Most suggest that some 60 million people died in the war, including about ||Battle_casualties_of_World_War_II|| and 40 million civilians. Many of the civilians died because of deliberate ||Genocide||, ||List_of_massacres||, ||Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II||, ||Infectious_disease||, and ||Starvation||. The Soviet Union alone lost around 27 million people during the war, including 8.7 million military and 19 million civilian deaths. A quarter of the total people in the Soviet Union were wounded or killed. Germany sustained 5.3 million military losses, mostly on the Eastern Front and during the final battles in Germany. An estimated 11 to 17 million civilians died as a direct or as an indirect result of Hitler's ||Racial_policy_of_Nazi_Germany||, including ||Mass_killing|| of ||The_Holocaust||, along with ||Romani_genocide||, ||Persecution_of_homosexuals_in_Nazi_Germany_and_the_Holocaust||, at least 1.9 million ethnic ||World_War_II_casualties_of_Poland|| and ||World_War_II_casualties_of_the_Soviet_Union|| (including Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians), and ||Holocaust_victims||. Between 1941 and 1945, more than 200,000 ethnic ||Serbs||, along with gypsies and Jews, were ||Persecution_of_Serbs_in_the_Independent_State_of_Croatia|| by the Axis-aligned Croatian ||Usta%C5%A1e|| in ||Yugoslavia||. Concurrently, ||Bosniaks|| and ||Croats|| were ||Chetnik_war_crimes_in_World_War_II|| by Serb nationalist ||Chetniks||, with an estimated 50,000-68,000 victims (of which 41,000 were civilians). Also, more than 100,000 Poles were massacred by the ||Ukrainian_Insurgent_Army|| in the ||Massacres_of_Poles_in_Volhynia_and_Eastern_Galicia||, between 1943 and 1945. At the same time, about 10,000–15,000 Ukrainians were killed by the Polish ||Home_Army|| and other Polish units, in reprisal attacks.  Bodies of Chinese civilians killed by the ||Imperial_Japanese_Army|| during the ||Nanking_Massacre|| in December 1937 In Asia and the Pacific, between 3 million and more than 10 million civilians, mostly Chinese (estimated at 7.5 million), were killed by the Japanese occupation forces. The most infamous Japanese atrocity was the ||Nanking_Massacre||, in which fifty to three hundred thousand Chinese civilians were raped and murdered. Mitsuyoshi Himeta reported that 2.7 million casualties occurred during the ||Three_Alls_Policy||. General ||Yasuji_Okamura|| implemented the policy in Heipei and ||Shantung||. Axis forces employed ||Biological_warfare|| and ||Chemical_warfare||.

Genocide, concentration camps, and slave labour Main articles: ||Genocide||, ||The_Holocaust||, ||Nazi_concentration_camps||, ||Extermination_camp||, ||Forced_labour_under_German_rule_during_World_War_II||, ||Kidnapping_of_children_by_Nazi_Germany||, ||Nazi_human_experimentation||, and ||Gulag||  ||Schutzstaffel|| (SS) female camp guards removing prisoners' bodies from lorries and carrying them to a mass grave, inside the German ||Bergen-Belsen_concentration_camp||, 1945 ||Nazi_Germany||, under the ||Dictatorship|| of Adolf Hitler, was responsible for ||The_Holocaust|| (which killed approximately 6 million Jews) as well as for ||Nazi_crimes_against_the_Polish_nation|| and 4 million others who were deemed "||Life_unworthy_of_life||" (including the ||Disability|| and ||Mental_disorder||, ||German_mistreatment_of_Soviet_prisoners_of_war||, ||Romani_people||, ||Homosexuals||, ||Freemasons||, and ||Jehovah%27s_Witnesses||) as part of a programme of deliberate extermination, in effect becoming a "genocidal state". ||German_mistreatment_of_Soviet_prisoners_of_war|| were kept in especially unbearable conditions, and 3.6 million Soviet POWs out of 5.7 million died in Nazi camps during the war. In addition to ||Nazi_concentration_camps||, ||Extermination_camp|| were created in Nazi Germany to exterminate people on an industrial scale. Nazi Germany extensively used ||Forced_labour_under_German_rule_during_World_War_II||; about 12 million ||Ostarbeiter|| from German-occupied countries were abducted and used as a slave work force in German industry, agriculture and war economy. The Soviet ||Gulag|| became a de facto system of deadly camps during 1942–43, when wartime privation and hunger caused numerous deaths of inmates, including foreign citizens of Poland and ||Occupation_of_Baltic_States|| occupied in 1939–40 by the Soviet Union, as well as Axis ||German_prisoners_of_war_in_the_Soviet_Union||. By the end of the war, most Soviet POWs liberated from Nazi camps and many repatriated civilians were detained in special filtration camps where they were subjected to ||NKVD|| evaluation, and 226,127 were sent to the Gulag as real or perceived Nazi collaborators.  Prisoner identity photograph taken by the German ||SS|| of ||Czes%C5%82awa_Kwoka||, a Polish Catholic girl deported to ||Auschwitz||. Approximately 230,000 children were held prisoner and used in forced labour and ||Nazi_human_experimentation||. Japanese ||Prisoner-of-war_camp||, many of which were used as labour camps, also had high death rates. The ||International_Military_Tribunal_for_the_Far_East|| found the death rate of Western prisoners was 27 per cent (for American POWs, 37 per cent), seven times that of POWs under the Germans and Italians. While 37,583 prisoners from the UK, 28,500 from the Netherlands, and 14,473 from the United States were released after the ||Surrender_of_Japan||, the number of Chinese released was only 56. At least five million Chinese civilians from northern China and Manchukuo were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the ||East_Asia_Development_Board||, or Kōain, for work in mines and war industries. After 1942, the number reached 10 million. In ||Java||, between 4 and 10 million ||R%C5%8Dmusha|| (Japanese: "manual labourers"), were forced to work by the Japanese military. About 270,000 of these Javanese labourers were sent to other Japanese-held areas in South East Asia, and only 52,000 were repatriated to Java. Occupation Main articles: ||German-occupied_Europe||, ||Resistance_during_World_War_II||, ||Collaboration_with_the_Axis_Powers||, and ||Nazi_plunder||  Polish civilians wearing blindfolds photographed just before ||Palmiry_massacre||, 1940 In Europe, occupation came under two forms. In Western, Northern, and Central Europe (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, and the ||Protectorate_of_Bohemia_and_Moravia||) Germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69.5 billion reichsmarks (27.8 billion US dollars) by the end of the war; this figure does not include the ||Nazi_plunder|| of industrial products, military equipment, raw materials and other goods. Thus, the income from occupied nations was over 40 percent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 percent of total German income as the war went on.  ||Soviet_partisans|| hanged by the German army. The ||Russian_Academy_of_Sciences|| reported in 1995 ||World_War_II_casualties_of_the_Soviet_Union|| at German hands totalled 13.7 million dead, twenty percent of the 68 million persons in the occupied Soviet Union. In the East, the intended gains of ||Lebensraum|| were never attained as fluctuating front-lines and Soviet ||Scorched_earth|| policies denied resources to the German invaders. Unlike in the West, the ||Racial_policy_of_Nazi_Germany|| encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered to be the "||Untermensch||" of Slavic descent; most German advances were thus followed by ||Generalplan_Ost||. Although ||Resistance_during_World_War_II|| formed in most occupied territories, they did not significantly hamper German operations in either the East or the West until late 1943. In Asia, Japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the ||Greater_East_Asia_Co-Prosperity_Sphere||, essentially a Japanese ||Hegemony|| which it claimed was for purposes of liberating colonised peoples. Although Japanese forces were sometimes welcomed as liberators from European domination, ||Japanese_war_crimes|| frequently turned local public opinion against them. During Japan's initial conquest, it captured 4,000,000 barrels (640,000 m) of oil (~550,000 tonnes) left behind by retreating Allied forces; and by 1943, was able to get production in the Dutch East Indies up to 50 million barrels (7,900,000 m) of oil (~6.8 million tonnes), 76 per cent of its 1940 output rate. Home fronts and production Main articles: ||Military_production_during_World_War_II|| and ||Home_front_during_World_War_II|| Allies to Axis GDP ratio between 1938 and 1945 In Europe, before the outbreak of the war, the Allies had significant advantages in both population and economics. In 1938, the Western Allies (United Kingdom, France, Poland and the British Dominions) had a 30 percent larger population and a 30 percent higher gross domestic product than the European Axis powers (Germany and Italy); if colonies are included, the Allies had more than a 5:1 advantage in population and a nearly 2:1 advantage in GDP. In Asia at the same time, China had roughly six times the population of Japan but only an 89 percent higher GDP; this is reduced to three times the population and only a 38 percent higher GDP if Japanese colonies are included. The United States produced about two-thirds of all the munitions used by the Allies in World War II, including warships, transports, warplanes, artillery, tanks, trucks, and ammunition. Though the Allies' economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany and Japan, they became the decisive factor by 1942, after the United States and Soviet Union joined the Allies, as the war largely settled into one of ||Attrition_warfare||. While the Allies' ability to out-produce the Axis is often attributed to the Allies having more access to natural resources, other factors, such as Germany and Japan's reluctance to employ women in the ||Labour_force||, Allied ||Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II||, and Germany's late shift to a ||War_economy|| contributed significantly. Additionally, neither Germany nor Japan planned to fight a protracted war, and had not equipped themselves to do so. To improve their production, Germany and Japan used millions of ||Slave_labour||; ||Forced_labour_under_German_rule_during_World_War_II|| about 12 million people, mostly from Eastern Europe, while ||Slavery_in_Japan|| more than 18 million people in Far East Asia. Advances in technology and warfare Main article: ||Technology_during_World_War_II||  ||Boeing_B-29_Superfortress|| ||Strategic_bombers|| on the ||Boeing|| assembly line in ||Wichita,_Kansas||, 1944 Aircraft were used for ||Reconnaissance_aircraft||, as ||Fighter_aircraft||, ||Bomber||, and ||Close_air_support||, and each role was advanced considerably. Innovation included ||Airlift|| (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and personnel); and of ||Strategic_bombing|| (the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war). ||Anti-aircraft_warfare|| also advanced, including defences such as ||Radar|| and surface-to-air artillery. The use of the ||Jet_aircraft|| was pioneered and, though late introduction meant it had little impact, it led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide. Although ||Missile|| were being developed, they were not advanced enough to reliably ||Surface-to-air_missile|| until some years after the war. Advances were made in nearly every aspect of ||Naval_warfare||, most notably with ||Aircraft_carrier|| and ||Submarine||. Although ||Aeronautics|| warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war, ||Battle_of_Taranto||, ||Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor||, and the ||Battle_of_the_Coral_Sea|| established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of the battleship. In the Atlantic, ||Escort_carrier|| proved to be a vital part of Allied convoys, increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the ||Mid-Atlantic_gap||. Carriers were also more economical than ||Battleship|| because of the relatively low cost of aircraft and their not requiring to be as heavily armoured. Submarines, which had proved to be an effective weapon during the ||World_War_I||, were anticipated by all sides to be important in the second. The British focused development on ||Anti-submarine_warfare|| ||Anti-submarine_weapon|| and tactics, such as ||Sonar|| and convoys, while Germany focused on improving its offensive capability, with designs such as the ||German_Type_VII_submarine|| and ||Wolfpack_(naval_tactic)|| tactics. Gradually, improving Allied technologies such as the ||Leigh_light||, ||Hedgehog_(weapon)||, ||Squid_(weapon)||, and ||Mark_24_mine|| proved victorious over the German submarines.  A ||V-2_rocket|| launched from a fixed site in ||Peenem%C3%BCnde||, 21 June 1943 ||Land_warfare|| changed from the static front lines of ||Trench_warfare|| of World War I, which had relied on improved ||Artillery|| that outmatched the speed of both ||Infantry|| and ||Cavalry||, to increased mobility and ||Combined_arms||. The ||Tank||, which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon. In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during World War I, and ||Tanks_in_World_War_II|| with increases in speed, armour and firepower. At the start of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications. This idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and German doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat. This, along with Germany's use of combined arms, were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France. Many means of ||Anti-tank_warfare||, including ||Indirect_fire||, ||Anti-tank_gun|| (both towed and ||Self-propelled_gun||), ||Anti-tank_mine||, short-ranged infantry antitank weapons, and other tanks were used. Even with large-scale mechanisation, infantry remained the backbone of all forces, and throughout the war, most infantry were equipped similarly to World War I. The portable machine gun spread, a notable example being the German ||MG34||, and various ||Submachine_gun|| which were suited to ||Close_combat|| in urban and jungle settings. The ||Assault_rifle||, a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and submachine gun, became the standard post-war infantry weapon for most armed forces.  Nuclear Gadget being raised to the top of the detonation "shot tower", at ||Alamogordo_Bombing_and_Gunnery_Range||; ||Trinity_(nuclear_test)||, ||New_Mexico||, July 1945 Most major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security involved in using large ||Codebook|| for ||Cryptography|| by designing ||Cipher|| machines, the most well known being the German ||Enigma_machine||. Development of ||SIGINT|| (signals intelligence) and ||Cryptanalysis|| enabled the countering process of decryption. Notable examples were the Allied decryption of ||Japanese_naval_codes|| and British ||Ultra||, a ||Bombe#The_British_Bombe|| for decoding Enigma benefiting from information given to the United Kingdom by the ||Polish_Cipher_Bureau#Gift_to_allies||, which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the war. Another aspect of ||Military_intelligence|| was the use of ||Deception||, which the Allies used to great effect, such as in operations ||Operation_Mincemeat|| and ||Operation_Bodyguard||. Other technological and engineering feats achieved during, or as a result of, the war include the world's first programmable computers (||Z3_(computer)||, ||Colossus_computer||, and ||ENIAC||), ||V-1_flying_bomb|| and ||V-2_rocket||, the ||Manhattan_Project||'s development of ||Nuclear_weapon||, ||Operations_research|| and the development of ||Mulberry_harbour|| and ||Operation_Pluto||. ||Penicillin|| was first mass-produced and used during the war (see ||History_of_penicillin#Stabilization_and_mass_production||).
