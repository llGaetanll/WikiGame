born August 4, 1961) is an American politician who served as the 44th ||President_of_the_United_States|| from 2009 to 2017. A member of the ||Democratic_Party_(United_States)||, Obama was the first African-American president of the United States. He previously served as a ||U.S._senator|| from ||Illinois|| from 2005 to 2008 and as an ||Illinois_state_senator|| from 1997 to 2004.  Obama was born in ||Honolulu||, ||Hawaii||. After graduating from ||Columbia_University|| in 1983, he worked as a ||Community_organizing|| in ||Chicago||. In 1988, he enrolled in ||Harvard_Law_School||, where he was the first black president of the ||Harvard_Law_Review||. After graduating, he became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the ||University_of_Chicago_Law_School|| from 1992 to 2004. Turning to elective politics, he ||Illinois_Senate_career_of_Barack_Obama|| in the ||Illinois_Senate|| from 1997 until 2004, when he ||2004_United_States_Senate_election_in_Illinois||. Obama received national attention in 2004 with his March Senate primary win, his well-received July ||2004_Democratic_National_Convention|| ||2004_Democratic_National_Convention_keynote_address||, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, a year after beginning ||Barack_Obama_2008_presidential_campaign||, and after ||2008_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries|| against ||Hillary_Clinton||, he was nominated by the Democratic Party for president. Obama was elected over ||Republican_Party_(United_States)|| nominee ||John_McCain|| in the ||2008_United_States_presidential_election|| and was ||First_inauguration_of_Barack_Obama|| alongside his running mate ||Joe_Biden||, on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, he was named the ||2009_Nobel_Peace_Prize|| laureate, a decision that drew a mixture of praise and criticism. Obama signed many landmark bills into law during his first two ||Presidency_of_Barack_Obama||. The main reforms include: the ||Affordable_Care_Act|| (ACA or "Obamacare"), although without a ||Public_health_insurance_option||; the ||Dodd%E2%80%93Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act||; and the ||Don%27t_Ask,_Don%27t_Tell_Repeal_Act_of_2010||. The ||American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009|| and ||Tax_Relief,_Unemployment_Insurance_Reauthorization,_and_Job_Creation_Act_of_2010|| served as economic stimuli amidst the ||Great_Recession_in_the_United_States||. After a ||United_States_debt-ceiling_crisis_of_2011||, he signed the ||Budget_Control_Act_of_2011|| and the ||American_Taxpayer_Relief_Act_of_2012||. In foreign policy, he increased U.S. troop levels in ||War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%93present)||, reduced nuclear weapons with the United States–||Russia|| ||New_START|| treaty, and ||Withdrawal_of_U.S._troops_from_Iraq_(2007%E2%80%932011)|| in the ||Iraq_War||. In 2011, Obama ordered the drone-strike killing of ||Anwar_al-Awlaki||, a US citizen and suspected ||Al-Qaeda|| operative, leading to controversy. He ordered ||2011_military_intervention_in_Libya|| for the implementation of the ||United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1973||, contributing to the overthrow of ||Muammar_Gaddafi||. He also ordered the ||Killing_of_Osama_bin_Laden#Operation_Neptune_Spear|| that resulted in the death of ||Osama_bin_Laden||. After winning ||2012_United_States_presidential_election|| by defeating Republican opponent ||Mitt_Romney||, Obama was ||Second_inauguration_of_Barack_Obama|| on January 20, 2013. During this term, he promoted inclusion for ||LGBT_American||. His administration filed briefs that urged the ||Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States|| to strike down ||Same-sex_marriage_in_the_United_States|| bans as unconstitutional (||United_States_v._Windsor|| and ||Obergefell_v._Hodges||); same-sex marriage was ||Same-sex_marriage_in_the_United_States|| nationwide in 2015 after the Court ruled so in Obergefell. He advocated for ||Gun_politics_in_the_United_States|| in response to the ||Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting||, indicating support for a ban on ||Assault_weapons||, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning ||Global_warming|| and immigration. In foreign policy, he ordered ||American-led_intervention_in_Iraq_(2014%E2%80%93present)|| and ||American-led_intervention_in_the_Syrian_civil_war|| in response to gains made by ||Islamic_State|| after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 ||Paris_Agreement|| on global climate change, oversaw and ultimately apologized for the deadly ||Kunduz_hospital_airstrike||, drew down ||Withdrawal_of_United_States_troops_from_Afghanistan_(2011%E2%80%932016)|| in 2016, initiated ||International_sanctions_during_the_Ukrainian_crisis|| following the ||Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation|| and again after ||Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections||, brokered the ||Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action|| nuclear deal with Iran, and ||Cuban_thaw||. Obama nominated ||Barack_Obama_Supreme_Court_candidates||: ||Sonia_Sotomayor|| and ||Elena_Kagan|| were confirmed as justices, while ||Merrick_Garland|| was ||Merrick_Garland_Supreme_Court_nomination|| from the Republican-majority ||United_States_Senate||. Obama left office on January 20, 2017, and continues to reside in ||Washington,_D.C.|| During Obama's ||Presidency_of_Barack_Obama||, the United States' reputation abroad, as well as the American economy, significantly improved. Obama's presidency has generally been regarded favorably, and evaluations of his presidency among historians, political scientists, and the general public frequently place him among ||Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States#Notable_scholar_surveys|| of American presidents. Since leaving office, Obama has remained active in Democratic politics, including campaigning for candidates in the ||2018_United_States_elections||, appearing at the ||2020_Democratic_National_Convention|| and campaigning for Biden during the ||2020_United_States_presidential_election||. Outside of politics, Obama has published three ||Bibliography_of_Barack_Obama||: ||Dreams_from_My_Father|| (1995), ||The_Audacity_of_Hope|| (2006) and ||A_Promised_Land|| (2020). Contents Early life and career Main article: ||Early_life_and_career_of_Barack_Obama||  ||Stanley_Armour_Dunham||, ||Ann_Dunham||, ||Maya_Soetoro-Ng|| and Barack Obama, (L to R) mid-1970s in ||Honolulu|| Obama was born on August 4, 1961, at ||Kapiolani_Medical_Center_for_Women_and_Children|| in ||Honolulu||, ||Hawaii||. He is the only president born outside the ||Contiguous_United_States||. He was born to an American mother and a Kenyan father. His mother, ||Ann_Dunham|| (1942–1995), was born in ||Wichita,_Kansas||; she was mostly of English descent. In July 2012, ||Ancestry.com|| found a strong likelihood that Dunham was descended from ||John_Punch_(slave)||, an enslaved African man who lived in the ||Colony_of_Virginia|| during the seventeenth century. Obama's father, ||Barack_Obama_Sr.|| (1934–1982), was a married ||Luo_people_of_Kenya_and_Tanzania|| from ||Nyang%27oma_Kogelo||. Obama's parents met in 1960 in a ||Russian_language|| class at the ||University_of_Hawaii_at_Manoa||, where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship. The couple married in ||Wailuku,_Hawaii||, on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born. In late August 1961, a few weeks after he was born, Barack and his mother moved to the ||University_of_Washington|| in ||Seattle||, where they lived for a year. During that time, Barack's father completed his undergraduate degree in ||Economics|| in Hawaii, graduating in June 1962. He left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at ||Harvard_University||, where he earned an ||Master_of_Arts|| in economics. Obama's parents divorced in March 1964. Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for the Kenyan government as the Senior Economic Analyst in the Ministry of Finance. He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas 1971, before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old. Recalling his early childhood, Obama said: "That my father looked nothing like the people around me—that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk—barely registered in my mind." He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage. In 1963, Dunham met ||Lolo_Soetoro|| at the ||University_of_Hawaii||; he was an ||Native_Indonesian|| ||East%E2%80%93West_Center|| ||Graduate_student|| in ||Geography||. The couple married on ||Molokai|| on March 15, 1965. After two one-year extensions of his ||J-1_visa||, Lolo returned to ||Indonesia|| in 1966. His wife and stepson followed sixteen months later in 1967. The family initially lived in the Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the ||Tebet,_South_Jakarta|| district of ||South_Jakarta||. From 1970, they lived in a wealthier neighborhood in the ||Menteng|| district of ||Central_Jakarta||. Education  Barack Obama's school record in St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School. Obama was enrolled as "Barry Soetoro" (no. 1), and was wrongly recorded as an Indonesian citizen (no. 3) and a Muslim (no. 4). At the age of six, Obama and his mother had moved to Indonesia to join his stepfather. From age six to ten, he attended local ||Indonesian_Language|| schools: Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and ||State_Elementary_School_Menteng_01|| (State Elementary School Menteng 01) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language ||Calvert_School|| homeschooling by his mother. As a result of his four years in ||Jakarta||, he was able to speak ||Indonesian_language|| fluently as a child. During his time in Indonesia, Obama's stepfather taught him to be resilient and gave him "a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works." In 1971, Obama returned to ||Honolulu|| to live with his maternal grandparents, ||Madelyn_Dunham|| and ||Stanley_Armour_Dunham||. He attended ||Punahou_School||—a private ||University-preparatory_school||—with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979. In his youth, Obama went by the nickname "Barry". Obama lived with his mother and half-sister, ||Maya_Soetoro-Ng||, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in ||Anthropology|| at the ||University_of_Hawaii||. Obama chose to stay in Hawaii when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975, so his mother could begin anthropology field work. His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a ||PhD|| degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ||Ovarian_cancer|| and ||Uterine_cancer||. Of his years in Honolulu, Obama wrote: "The opportunity that Hawaii offered — to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect — became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear." Obama has also written and talked about using ||Alcohol_(drug)||, ||Marijuana||, and ||Cocaine|| during his teenage years to "push questions of who I was out of my mind." Obama was also a member of the "choom gang", a self-named group of friends who spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana. After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to ||Los_Angeles|| to attend ||Occidental_College|| on a full scholarship. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the ||Disinvestment_from_South_Africa|| in response to that nation's policy of ||Apartheid||. In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in ||Pakistan|| and ||India|| for three weeks. Later in 1981, he ||College_transfer|| to ||Columbia_University|| in ||New_York_City|| as a ||Junior_(education)||, where he majored in ||Political_science|| with a specialty in ||International_relations|| and in ||English_literature|| and lived off-campus on West 109th Street. He graduated with a ||Bachelor_of_Arts|| degree in 1983 and a 3.7 ||Grading_(education)#United_States||. After graduating, Obama worked for about a year at the ||Business_International_Corporation||, where he was a financial researcher and writer, then as a project coordinator for the ||New_York_Public_Interest_Research_Group|| on the ||City_College_of_New_York|| campus for three months in 1985. Family and personal life Main article: ||Family_of_Barack_Obama|| In a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of ||Family_of_Barack_Obama||: "It's like a little mini-United Nations," he said. "I've got relatives who look like ||Bernie_Mac||, and I've got relatives who look like ||Margaret_Thatcher||." Obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised (||Maya_Soetoro-Ng||) and seven other half-siblings from his Kenyan father's family—six of them living. Obama's mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother, ||Madelyn_Dunham||, until her death on November 2, 2008, two days before his election to the presidency. Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in ||Moneygall|| in May 2011. In Dreams from My Father, Obama ties his mother's family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of ||Jefferson_Davis||, ||President_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America|| during the ||American_Civil_War||. He also shares distant ancestors in common with ||George_W._Bush|| and ||Dick_Cheney||, among others. Obama lived with anthropologist ||Sheila_Miyoshi_Jager|| while he was a community organizer in Chicago in the 1980s. He proposed to her twice, but both Jager and her parents turned him down. The relationship was not made public until May 2017, several months after his presidency had ended.  Obama poses in the ||Green_Room_(White_House)|| of the White House with wife Michelle and daughters Sasha and Malia, 2009 In June 1989, Obama met ||Michelle_Obama|| when he was employed as a summer associate at the Chicago law firm of ||Sidley_Austin||. Robinson was assigned for three months as Obama's adviser at the firm, and she joined him at several group social functions but declined his initial requests to date. They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992. After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent ||In_vitro_fertilization|| to conceive their children. The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998, followed by a second daughter, Natasha ("Sasha"), in 2001. The Obama daughters attended the ||University_of_Chicago_Laboratory_Schools||. When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the ||Sidwell_Friends_School||. The Obamas had two ||Portuguese_Water_Dog||; the first, a male named ||Bo_(dog)||, was a gift from Senator ||Ted_Kennedy||. In 2013, Bo was joined by ||Sunny_(dog)||, a female. Bo died of cancer on May 8, 2021.  Obama playing in a ||Pick-up_game|| on the ||White_House|| basketball court, 2009 Obama is a supporter of the ||Chicago_White_Sox||, and he threw out the first pitch at the ||2005_American_League_Championship_Series|| when he was still a senator. In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the ||2009_Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game|| while wearing a White Sox jacket. He is also primarily a ||Chicago_Bears|| football fan in the ||National_Football_League||, but in his childhood and adolescence was a ||Steeler_Nation||, and rooted for them ahead of their victory in ||Super_Bowl_XLIII|| 12 days after he took office as president. In 2011, Obama invited the ||1985_Chicago_Bears_season|| to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their ||Super_Bowl_XX|| in 1986 due to the ||Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster||. He plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school's varsity team, and he is left-handed. In 2005, the Obama family applied the proceeds of a book deal and moved from a ||Hyde_Park,_Chicago|| condominium to a $1.6 million house (equivalent to $2.1 million in 2020) in neighboring ||Kenwood,_Chicago||. The purchase of an adjacent lot—and sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend ||Tony_Rezko||—attracted media attention because of Rezko's subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama. In December 2007, ||Money_(magazine)|| estimated Obama's net worth at $1.3 million (equivalent to $1.6 million in 2020). Their 2009 tax return showed a household income of $5.5 million—up from about $4.2 million in 2007 and $1.6 million in 2005—mostly from sales of his books. On his 2010 income of $1.7 million, he gave 14 percent to non-profit organizations, including $131,000 to ||Fisher_House_Foundation||, a charity assisting wounded veterans' families, allowing them to reside near where the veteran is receiving medical treatments. Per his 2012 financial disclosure, Obama may be worth as much as $10 million. Religious views Obama is a ||Protestant|| Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life. He wrote in ||The_Audacity_of_Hope|| that he "was not raised in a religious household." He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet "in many ways the most spiritually awakened person ... I have ever known", and "a lonely witness for ||Secular_humanism||." He described his father as a "confirmed ||Atheism||" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as "a man who saw religion as not particularly useful." Obama explained how, through working with ||Black_church|| as a ||Community_organizing|| while in his twenties, he came to understand "the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change."  The Obamas worship at ||African_Methodist_Episcopal_Church|| in Washington, D.C., January 2013 In January 2008, Obama told ||Christianity_Today||: "I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the ||Redeemer_(Christianity)|| and ||Resurrection_of_Jesus|| Christ. I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life." On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views, saying: I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't—frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of ||Jesus_Christ|| spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead—being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, ||Golden_Rule||. Obama met ||Trinity_United_Church_of_Christ|| pastor ||Jeremiah_Wright|| in October 1987 and became a member of Trinity in 1992. During Obama's first presidential campaign in May 2008, he resigned from Trinity after ||Jeremiah_Wright_controversy||. Since moving to Washington, D.C., in 2009, the Obama family has attended several Protestant churches, including ||Shiloh_Baptist_Church_(Washington,_D.C.)|| and ||St._John%27s_Episcopal_Church,_Lafayette_Square||, as well as Evergreen Chapel at ||Camp_David||, but the members of the family do not attend church on a regular basis. In 2016, he said that he gets inspiration from a few items that remind him "of all the different people I've met along the way", adding: "I carry these around all the time. I'm not that superstitious, so it's not like I think I necessarily have to have them on me at all times." The items, "a whole bowl full", include rosary beads given to him by ||Pope_Francis||, a figurine of the Hindu deity ||Hanuman||, a ||Coptic_cross|| from Ethiopia, a small ||Buddha_statue|| given by a monk, and a metal poker chip that used to be the lucky charm of a motorcyclist in Iowa. Law career Community organizer and Harvard Law School Two years after graduating from Columbia, Obama moved from New York to Chicago when he was hired as director of the ||Developing_Communities_Project||, a church-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in ||Roseland,_Chicago||, ||West_Pullman,_Chicago||, and ||Riverdale,_Chicago|| on Chicago's ||South_Side,_Chicago||. He worked there as a community organizer from June 1985 to May 1988. He helped set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization in ||Altgeld_Gardens_Homes_(Chicago,_Illinois)||. Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the ||Gamaliel_Foundation||, a community organizing institute. In mid-1988, he traveled for the first time in Europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his ||Family_of_Barack_Obama#Paternal_relations|| for the first time. External video , April 24, 1990, 11:34, ||WGBH_Educational_Foundation|| Student Barack Obama introduces Professor Derrick Bell starting at 6:25. Despite being offered a full scholarship to ||Northwestern_University_School_of_Law||, Obama enrolled at ||Harvard_Law_School|| in the fall of 1988, living in nearby ||Somerville,_Massachusetts||. He was selected as an editor of the ||Harvard_Law_Review|| at the end of his first year, president of the journal in his second year, and research assistant to the constitutional scholar ||Laurence_Tribe|| while at Harvard for two years. During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as a ||Associate_attorney#Summer_associates|| at the law firms of ||Sidley_Austin|| in 1989 and ||Hopkins_%26_Sutter|| in 1990. After graduating with a ||Juris_Doctor|| degree ||Magna_cum_laude|| from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago. Obama's election as the ||List_of_African-American_firsts|| gained national media attention and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations, which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as ||Dreams_from_My_Father||. University of Chicago Law School In 1991, Obama accepted a two-year position as Visiting Law and Government Fellow at the ||University_of_Chicago_Law_School|| to work on his first book. He then taught ||Constitutional_law|| at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years, first as a ||Lecturer|| from 1992 to 1996, and then as a senior lecturer from 1996 to 2004. From April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois's ||Project_Vote||, a ||Voter_registration_campaign|| with ten staffers and seven hundred volunteer registrars; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, leading ||Crain%27s_Chicago_Business|| to name Obama to its 1993 list of "40 under Forty" powers to be. Civil Rights attorney He joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a 13-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an ||Associate_attorney|| for three years from 1993 to 1996, then ||Of_counsel|| from 1996 to 2004. In 1994, he was listed as one of the lawyers in Buycks-Roberson v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank, 94 C 4094 (N.D. Ill.). This ||Class-action_lawsuit|| was filed in 1994 with Selma Buycks-Roberson as lead plaintiff and alleged that Citibank Federal Savings Bank had engaged in practices forbidden under the ||Equal_Credit_Opportunity_Act|| and the ||Fair_Housing_Act||. The case was settled out of court. Final judgment was issued on May 13, 1998, with Citibank Federal Savings Bank agreeing to pay attorney fees. From 1994 to 2002, Obama served on the boards of directors of the ||Woods_Fund_of_Chicago||—which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the Developing Communities Project—and of the ||Joyce_Foundation||. He served on the board of directors of the ||Chicago_Annenberg_Challenge|| from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999. Obama's law license became inactive in 2007. Legislative career Illinois Senate (1997–2004) Main article: ||Illinois_Senate_career_of_Barack_Obama||  State Senator Obama and others celebrate the naming of a street in Chicago after ||ShoreBank|| co-founder Milton Davis in 1998 Obama was elected to the ||Illinois_Senate|| in 1996, succeeding Democratic State Senator ||Alice_Palmer_(politician)|| from Illinois's 13th District, which, at that time, spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from ||Hyde_Park,_Chicago||–||Kenwood,_Chicago|| south to ||South_Shore,_Chicago|| and west to ||Chicago_Lawn,_Chicago||. Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws. He sponsored a law that increased ||Tax_credit|| for low-income workers, negotiated ||Welfare_reform||, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare. In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan's ||Payday_loan|| regulations and ||Predatory_lending|| regulations aimed at averting home ||Foreclosure||. He was reelected to the Illinois Senate in 1998, defeating Republican Yesse Yehudah in the general election, and was re-elected again in 2002. In 2000, he lost a ||2000_Illinois%27s_1st_congressional_district_election|| for ||Illinois%27s_1st_congressional_district|| in the ||United_States_House_of_Representatives|| to four-term incumbent ||Bobby_Rush|| by a margin of two to one. In January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Illinois Senate's Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority. He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor ||Racial_profiling|| by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained, and legislation making Illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations. During his 2004 general election campaign for the U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting ||Capital_punishment_in_the_United_States|| reforms. Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate. 2004 U.S. Senate campaign Main article: ||2004_United_States_Senate_election_in_Illinois||  Results of the 2004 U.S. Senate race in Illinois; Obama won the counties in blue. In May 2002, Obama commissioned a poll to assess his prospects in a 2004 U.S. Senate race. He created a campaign committee, began raising funds, and lined up political media consultant ||David_Axelrod_(political_consultant)|| by August 2002. Obama formally announced his candidacy in January 2003. Obama was an early opponent of the ||George_W._Bush|| administration's ||2003_invasion_of_Iraq||. On October 2, 2002, the day President Bush and Congress agreed on the ||Iraq_Resolution|| authorizing the ||Iraq_War||, Obama addressed the first high-profile Chicago ||Protests_against_the_Iraq_War||, and spoke out against the war. He addressed another anti-war rally in March 2003 and told the crowd "it's not too late" to stop the war. Decisions by Republican incumbent ||Peter_Fitzgerald_(politician)|| and his Democratic predecessor ||Carol_Moseley_Braun|| to not participate in the election resulted in wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving 15 candidates. In the March 2004 primary election, Obama won in an unexpected landslide—which overnight made him a rising star within the ||Democratic_National_Committee||, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, Dreams from My Father. In July 2004, Obama delivered the keynote address at the ||2004_Democratic_National_Convention||, seen by nine million viewers. His speech was well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party. Obama's expected opponent in the general election, Republican primary winner ||Jack_Ryan_(politician)||, withdrew from the race in June 2004. Six weeks later, ||Alan_Keyes|| accepted the Republican nomination to replace Ryan. In the ||2004_United_States_Senate_election_in_Illinois||, Obama won with 70 percent of the vote, the largest margin of victory for a Senate candidate in Illinois history. He took 92 of the state's 102 counties, including several where Democrats traditionally do not do well.

He introduced two initiatives that bore his name: Lugar–Obama, which expanded the ||Nunn%E2%80%93Lugar_Cooperative_Threat_Reduction|| concept to conventional weapons; and the ||Federal_Funding_Accountability_and_Transparency_Act_of_2006||, which authorized the establishment of USAspending.gov, a web search engine on federal spending. On June 3, 2008, Senator Obama—along with Senators ||Tom_Carper||, ||Tom_Coburn||, and ||John_McCain||—introduced follow-up legislation: Strengthening Transparency and Accountability in Federal Spending Act of 2008. He also ||Sponsor_(legislative)|| the ||Secure_America_and_Orderly_Immigration_Act||. In December 2006, President Bush signed into law the ||Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo|| Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act, marking the first federal legislation to be enacted with Obama as its primary sponsor. In January 2007, Obama and Senator Feingold introduced a corporate jet provision to the ||Honest_Leadership_and_Open_Government_Act||, which was signed into law in September 2007.  Obama and U.S. Senator ||Richard_Lugar|| (R-IN) visit a Russian facility for dismantling mobile missiles (August 2005) Later in 2007, Obama sponsored an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act to add safeguards for personality-disorder military discharges. This amendment passed the full Senate in the spring of 2008. He sponsored the ||Disinvestment_from_Iran|| supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran's oil and gas industry, which was never enacted but later incorporated in the ||Comprehensive_Iran_Sanctions,_Accountability,_and_Divestment_Act_of_2010||; and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism. Obama also sponsored a Senate amendment to the ||State_Children%27s_Health_Insurance_Program||, providing one year of job protection for family members caring for soldiers with combat-related injuries. Obama held assignments on the Senate Committees for ||United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Foreign_Relations||, ||United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Environment_and_Public_Works|| and ||United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Veterans%27_Affairs|| through December 2006. In January 2007, he left the Environment and Public Works committee and took additional assignments with ||United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Health,_Education,_Labor_and_Pensions|| and ||United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Homeland_Security_and_Governmental_Affairs||. He also became Chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on ||United_States_Senate_Foreign_Relations_Subcommittee_on_Europe_and_Regional_Security_Cooperation||. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Obama made official trips to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. He met with ||Mahmoud_Abbas|| before Abbas became ||President_of_the_Palestinian_National_Authority||, and gave a speech at the ||University_of_Nairobi|| in which he condemned corruption within the Kenyan government.

Obama won 365–173. On February 10, 2007, Obama announced his candidacy for President of the ||United_States|| in front of the ||Old_State_Capitol_State_Historic_Site_(Illinois)|| building in ||Springfield,_Illinois||. The choice of the announcement site was viewed as symbolic because it was also where ||Abraham_Lincoln|| delivered his historic ||Lincoln%27s_House_Divided_Speech|| speech in 1858. Obama emphasized issues of rapidly ending the ||Iraq_War||, increasing ||Energy_policy_of_the_United_States||, and ||Health_care_reform_in_the_United_States||, in a campaign that projected themes of hope and change. Numerous candidates entered the ||2008_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries||. The field narrowed to a duel between Obama and Senator ||Hillary_Clinton|| after early contests, with the race remaining close throughout the primary process but with Obama gaining a steady lead in pledged ||Delegate_(American_politics)|| due to better long-range planning, superior fundraising, dominant organizing in ||Caucus|| states, and better exploitation of delegate allocation rules. On June 7, 2008, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama. On August 23, 2008, Obama announced his ||2008_Democratic_Party_vice_presidential_candidate_selection|| of ||Delaware|| Senator ||Joe_Biden|| as his vice presidential running mate. Obama selected Biden from a field speculated to include former Indiana Governor and Senator ||Evan_Bayh|| and Virginia Governor ||Tim_Kaine||. At the ||2008_Democratic_National_Convention|| in ||Denver||, Colorado, Hillary Clinton called for her supporters to endorse Obama, and she and ||Bill_Clinton|| gave convention speeches in his support. Obama delivered his acceptance speech at ||Invesco_Field_at_Mile_High|| stadium to a crowd of about eighty-four thousand; the speech was viewed by over three million people worldwide. During both the primary process and the general election, Obama's campaign set numerous fundraising records, particularly in the quantity of small donations. On June 19, 2008, Obama became the first major-party presidential candidate to turn down ||Campaign_finance_in_the_United_States#Public_financing_of_campaigns|| in the general election since the system was created in 1976. ||John_McCain|| was nominated as the Republican candidate, and he selected ||Sarah_Palin|| as his running mate. Obama and McCain engaged in three ||United_States_presidential_election_debates|| in September and October 2008. On November 4, Obama won the presidency with 365 ||Electoral_College_(United_States)|| to 173 received by McCain. Obama won 52.9 percent of the ||Election|| to McCain's 45.7 percent. He became the first African-American to be elected president. Obama delivered ||Barack_Obama_election_victory_speech,_2008|| before hundreds of thousands of supporters in Chicago's ||Grant_Park_(Chicago)||. He is one of the three United States senators moved directly from the U.S. Senate to the White House, the others are ||Warren_G._Harding|| and ||John_F._Kennedy||. 2012 Main articles: ||2012_United_States_presidential_election|| and ||Barack_Obama_2012_presidential_campaign||  2012 electoral vote results. Obama won 332–206. On April 4, 2011, Obama filed election papers with the ||Federal_Election_Commission|| and then announced his reelection campaign for 2012 in a video titled "It Begins with Us" that he posted on his website. As the incumbent president, he ran virtually unopposed in the ||Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries,_2012||, and on April 3, 2012, Obama secured the 2778 ||2012_Democratic_National_Convention|| delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination. At the ||2012_Democratic_National_Convention|| in ||Charlotte,_North_Carolina||, Obama and ||Joe_Biden|| were formally nominated by former President ||Bill_Clinton|| as the Democratic Party candidates for president and vice president in the general election. Their main opponents were Republicans ||Mitt_Romney||, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Representative ||Paul_Ryan|| of Wisconsin. On November 6, 2012, Obama won 332 ||Electoral_College_(United_States)||, exceeding the 270 required for him to be reelected as president. With 51.1 percent of the popular vote, Obama became the first Democratic president since ||Franklin_D._Roosevelt|| to win the ||List_of_United_States_presidential_elections_by_popular_vote_margin|| twice. Obama addressed supporters and volunteers at Chicago's ||McCormick_Place|| after his reelection and said: "Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties." Presidency (2009–2017) Main article: ||Presidency_of_Barack_Obama|| For a chronological guide to this subject, see ||Timeline_of_the_Barack_Obama_presidency||. First 100 days Main article: ||First_100_days_of_Barack_Obama%27s_presidency||  Obama takes ||Oath_of_office_of_the_President_of_the_United_States|| administered by ||Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States|| ||John_Roberts|| at ||United_States_Capitol||, January 20, 2009 The ||First_inauguration_of_Barack_Obama|| as the 44th president took place on January 20, 2009. In his first few days in office, Obama issued ||Executive_order|| and ||Presidential_memorandum|| directing the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq. He ordered the closing of the ||Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp||, but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee. Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records. He also revoked President ||George_W._Bush||'s restoration of President ||Ronald_Reagan||'s ||Mexico_City_policy|| which prohibited federal aid to international ||Family_planning|| organizations that perform or provide counseling about ||Abortion||. Domestic policy See also: ||Social_policy_of_the_Barack_Obama_administration|| The first bill signed into law by Obama was the ||Lilly_Ledbetter_Fair_Pay_Act_of_2009||, relaxing the ||Statute_of_limitations|| for equal-pay lawsuits. Five days later, he signed the reauthorization of the ||State_Children%27s_Health_Insurance_Program|| to cover an additional four million uninsured children. In March 2009, Obama reversed a Bush-era policy that had limited funding of ||Embryonic_stem_cell|| research and pledged to develop "strict guidelines" on the research.  Obama delivers a ||Barack_Obama_speech_to_joint_session_of_Congress,_February_2009|| with Vice President ||Joe_Biden|| and ||Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives|| ||Nancy_Pelosi|| on February 24, 2009. Obama appointed two women to serve on the Supreme Court in the first two years of his presidency. He nominated ||Sonia_Sotomayor|| on May 26, 2009, to replace retiring ||Associate_Justice_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States|| ||David_Souter||; she was confirmed on August 6, 2009, becoming the first Supreme Court Justice of ||Hispanic|| descent. Obama nominated ||Elena_Kagan|| on May 10, 2010, to replace retiring Associate Justice ||John_Paul_Stevens||. She was confirmed on August 5, 2010, bringing the number of women sitting simultaneously on the Court to three for the first time in American history. On March 11, 2009, Obama created the ||White_House_Council_on_Women_and_Girls||, which formed part of the ||White_House_Office_of_Intergovernmental_Affairs||, having been established by ||Executive_order|| with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to the welfare of American women and girls. The council was chaired by ||Senior_Advisor_to_the_President|| ||Valerie_Jarrett||. Obama also established the ||White_House_Task_Force_to_Protect_Students_from_Sexual_Assault|| through a government memorandum on January 22, 2014, with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to sexual assault on college and university campuses throughout the United States. The co-chairs of the Task Force were Vice President Joe Biden and Jarrett. The Task Force was a development out of the White House Council on Women and Girls and ||Office_of_the_Vice_President_of_the_United_States||, and prior to that the 1994 ||Violence_Against_Women_Act|| first drafted by Biden. In a ||Space_policy_of_the_Barack_Obama_administration|| in April 2010, Obama announced a planned change in direction at ||NASA||, the U.S. space agency. He ended plans for a return of ||Human_spaceflight|| to the moon and development of the ||Ares_I|| rocket, ||Ares_V|| rocket and ||Constellation_program||, in favor of funding ||Earth_science|| projects, a new rocket type, research and development for an eventual crewed mission to Mars, and ongoing missions to the ||International_Space_Station||.  Obama visits an ||2012_Aurora,_Colorado_shooting|| victim at ||University_of_Colorado_Hospital||, 2012. On January 16, 2013, one month after the ||Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting||, Obama signed 23 executive orders and outlined a series of sweeping proposals regarding ||Gun_politics_in_the_United_States||. He urged Congress to reintroduce an ||Federal_Assault_Weapons_Ban|| on military-style ||Assault_weapons||, such as those used in several recent mass shootings, impose limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, introduce background checks on all gun sales, pass a ban on possession and sale of armor-piercing bullets, introduce harsher penalties for gun-traffickers, especially unlicensed dealers who buy arms for criminals and approving the appointment of the head of the federal ||Bureau_of_Alcohol,_Tobacco,_Firearms_and_Explosives|| for the first time since 2006. On January 5, 2016, Obama announced new executive actions extending background check requirements to more gun sellers. In a 2016 editorial in The New York Times, Obama compared the struggle for what he termed "common-sense gun reform" to ||Women%27s_suffrage|| and other ||Civil_rights_movements|| in American history. In 2011, Obama signed a four-year renewal of the Patriot Act. Following the ||Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present)|| by ||Whistleblower|| ||Edward_Snowden||, Obama condemned the leak as unpatriotic, but called for increased restrictions on the NSA to address violations of privacy. LGBT rights and same-sex marriage On October 8, 2009, Obama signed the ||Matthew_Shepard_and_James_Byrd_Jr._Hate_Crimes_Prevention_Act||, a measure that expanded the ||Hate_crime_laws_in_the_United_States#Federal_prosecution_of_hate_crimes|| to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. On October 30, 2009, Obama lifted the ban on travel to the United States by those infected with ||HIV||. The lifting of the ban was celebrated by ||Immigration_Equality||. On December 22, 2010, Obama signed the ||Don%27t_Ask,_Don%27t_Tell_Repeal_Act_of_2010||, which fulfilled a promise made in the 2008 presidential campaign to end the ||Don%27t_ask,_don%27t_tell|| policy of 1993 that had prevented gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the ||United_States_Armed_Forces||. In 2016, the Pentagon ended the policy that barred ||Transgender_personnel_in_the_United_States_military||.  The ||White_House|| was illuminated in rainbow colors on the evening of the Supreme Court same-sex marriage ruling, June 26, 2015. As a candidate for the Illinois state senate in 1996, Obama stated he favored legalizing ||Same-sex_marriage_in_the_United_States||. During his Senate run in 2004, he said he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners but opposed same-sex marriages. In 2008, he reaffirmed this position by stating "I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage." On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so. During his second ||Second_inauguration_of_Barack_Obama|| on January 21, 2013, Obama became the first U.S. president in office to call for full equality for gay Americans, and the first time that a president mentioned ||LGBT_rights_in_the_United_States|| or the word "gay" in an inaugural address. In 2013, the Obama administration filed briefs that urged the ||Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States|| to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of ||Hollingsworth_v._Perry|| (regarding ||Same-sex_marriage_in_the_United_States||) and ||United_States_v._Windsor|| (regarding the ||Defense_of_Marriage_Act||). Economic policy Main article: ||Economic_policy_of_the_Barack_Obama_administration||  Obama presents his first as president of the United States on January 24, 2009, discussing the ||American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009|| On February 17, 2009, Obama signed the ||American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009||, a $787 billion ||Stimulus_(economics)|| package aimed at helping the economy recover from the ||Great_Recession||. The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and ||Tax_incentive||, and direct assistance to individuals. In March 2009, Obama's ||Treasury_Secretary||, ||Timothy_Geithner||, took further steps to manage the ||Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308||, including introducing the ||Public%E2%80%93Private_Investment_Program_for_Legacy_Assets||, which contains provisions for buying up to $2 trillion in depreciated real estate assets.  ||United_States_federal_budget|| and ||National_debt_of_the_United_States|| increases, 2001–2016 Obama intervened in the ||Automotive_industry_crisis_of_2008%E2%80%9310|| in March 2009, renewing loans for ||General_Motors|| (GM) and ||Chrysler|| to continue operations while reorganizing. Over the following months the White House set terms for both firms' bankruptcies, including the ||Chrysler_Chapter_11_reorganization|| to Italian automaker ||Fiat|| and a ||General_Motors_Chapter_11_reorganization|| giving the U.S. government a temporary 60 percent equity stake in the company. In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment. He signed into law the ||Car_Allowance_Rebate_System||, known colloquially as "Cash for Clunkers", which temporarily boosted the economy. The Bush and Obama administrations authorized spending and loan guarantees from the ||Federal_Reserve_System|| and the ||United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury||. These guarantees totaled about $11.5 trillion, but only $3 trillion had been spent by the end of November 2009. On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan ||Budget_Control_Act_of_2011||. The legislation enforced limits on discretionary spending until 2021, established a procedure to increase the debt limit, created a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5 trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and established automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2 trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee did not achieve such savings. By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a ||Federal_government_of_the_United_States|| ||Default_(finance)|| on its obligations. The unemployment rate rose in 2009, reaching a peak in October at 10.0 percent and averaging 10.0 percent in the fourth quarter. Following a decrease to 9.7 percent in the first quarter of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6 percent in the second quarter, where it remained for the rest of the year. Between February and December 2010, employment rose by 0.8 percent, which was less than the average of 1.9 percent experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries. By November 2012, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent, decreasing to 6.7 percent in the last month of 2013. During 2014, the unemployment rate continued to decline, falling to 6.3 percent in the first quarter. GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a rate of 1.6 percent, followed by a 5.0 percent increase in the fourth quarter. Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7 percent in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year. In July 2010, the ||Federal_Reserve_System|| noted that economic activity continued to increase, but its pace had slowed, and chairman ||Ben_Bernanke|| said the economic outlook was "unusually uncertain". Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9 percent in 2010.  US employment statistics (||Unemployment_rate|| and monthly changes in net employment) during Obama's tenure as U.S. president The ||Congressional_Budget_Office|| (CBO) and a broad range of economists credit Obama's stimulus plan for economic growth. The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1–2.1 million, while conceding that "it is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package." Although an April 2010, survey of members of the ||National_Association_for_Business_Economics|| showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73 percent of 68 respondents believed the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment. The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original ||NATO|| members by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end of ||World_War_II||. The ||OECD|| credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus plan of the U.S. and the austerity measures in the European Union. Within a month of the ||2010_United_States_elections||, Obama announced a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the ||Bush_tax_cuts||, a one-year ||Federal_Insurance_Contributions_Act_tax|| reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for ||Estate_tax_in_the_United_States||. The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858 billion ||Tax_Relief,_Unemployment_Insurance_Reauthorization,_and_Job_Creation_Act_of_2010|| passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010. In December 2013, Obama declared that growing ||Income_inequality_in_the_United_States|| is a "defining challenge of our time" and called on Congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages. This came on the heels of the ||Fast_food_worker_strikes|| and ||Pope_Francis||' criticism of inequality and ||Trickle-down_economics||. Obama urged Congress to ratify a 12-nation free trade pact called the ||Trans-Pacific_Partnership||. Environmental policy See also: ||Climate_change_policy_of_the_United_States|| and ||Energy_policy_of_the_Barack_Obama_administration||  Obama at a 2010 briefing on the ||BP_oil_spill|| at the ||United_States_Coast_Guard|| Station Venice in ||Venice,_Louisiana|| On April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore ||Drilling_rig|| at the ||Macondo_Prospect|| in the ||Gulf_of_Mexico||, causing a ||Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill||. Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by ||United_States_Secretary_of_the_Interior|| ||Ken_Salazar|| and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new ||Deepwater_drilling|| permits and leases, pending regulatory review. As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government. Prior to the oil spill, on March 31, 2010, Obama ended a ban on oil and gas drilling along the majority of the ||East_Coast_of_the_United_States|| and along the coast of ||Arctic_Alaska|| in an effort to win support for an energy and climate bill and to reduce foreign imports of oil and gas. In July 2013, Obama expressed reservations and said he "would reject the ||Keystone_XL_pipeline|| if it increased carbon pollution [or] greenhouse emissions." On February 24, 2015, Obama vetoed a bill that would have authorized the pipeline. It was the third veto of Obama's presidency and his first major veto. In December 2016, Obama permanently banned new offshore oil and gas drilling in most United States-owned waters in the ||Atlantic_Ocean|| and ||Arctic_Ocean|| using the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Act. Obama emphasized the ||Conservation_movement|| of ||Federal_lands|| during his term in office. He used his power under the ||Antiquities_Act|| to create 25 new ||National_monument_(United_States)|| during his presidency and expand four others, protecting a total of 553,000,000 acres (224,000,000 ha) of federal lands and waters, more than any other U.S. president. Health care reform Main article: ||Healthcare_reform_in_the_United_States||  Obama signs the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act at the White House, March 23, 2010. Obama called for ||United_States_Congress|| to pass legislation reforming ||Health_care_in_the_United_States||, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal. He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, cap premium increases, and allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900 billion over ten years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the ||Public_health_insurance_option||, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for ||Pre-existing_condition||, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.  Maximum Out-of-Pocket Premium as Percentage of Family Income and ||Federal_poverty_level||, under ||Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act||, starting in 2014 (Source: ||Congressional_Research_Service||) On July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009. After public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivered ||Barack_Obama_speech_to_joint_session_of_Congress,_September_2009|| on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals. In March 2009, Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research. On November 7, 2009, a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House. On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill—without a public option—on a party-line vote of 60–39. On March 21, 2010, the ||Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act|| (ACA) passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212. Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010. The ACA includes ||Provisions_of_the_Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act||, most of which took effect in 2014, including expanding ||Medicaid|| eligibility for people making up to 133 percent of the ||Federal_poverty_level|| (FPL) starting in 2014, subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400 percent of the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum "out-of-pocket" payment for annual premiums will be from 2 percent to 9.5 percent of income, providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing ||Health_insurance_exchange||, prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research. According to White House and CBO figures, the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level.  Percentage of Individuals in the United States without Health Insurance, 1963–2015 (Source: ||JAMA_(journal)||) The costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-income ||Tax_bracket||, taxes on ||Indoor_tanning||, cuts to the ||Medicare_Advantage|| program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies; there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons. In March 2010, the CBO estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143 billion over the first decade. The law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5–4 vote in ||National_Federation_of_Independent_Business_v._Sebelius|| that the mandate was constitutional under the U.S. Congress's taxing authority. In ||Burwell_v._Hobby_Lobby_Stores,_Inc.|| the Court ruled that "closely-held" for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the ||Religious_Freedom_Restoration_Act|| from regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives. In June 2015, the Court ruled 6–3 in ||King_v._Burwell|| that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges, not only those purchasing plans "established by the State", as the statute reads. Foreign policy Main article: ||Foreign_policy_of_the_Barack_Obama_administration||  June 4, 2009 − after his speech ||A_New_Beginning_(speech)|| at ||Cairo_University||, U.S. President Obama participates in a roundtable interview in 2009 with among others ||Jamal_Khashoggi||, ||Bambang_Harymurti|| and ||Nahum_Barnea||.  Obama with Indian Prime Minister ||Narendra_Modi|| at ||Hyderabad_House|| in ||New_Delhi||, January 2015. In February and March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden and ||United_States_Secretary_of_State|| Hillary Clinton made separate overseas trips to announce a "new era" in U.S. foreign relations with Russia and Europe, using the terms "break" and "||Russian_reset||" to signal major changes from the policies of the preceding administration. Obama attempted to reach out to Arab leaders by granting his first interview to an Arab satellite TV network, ||Al_Arabiya||. On March 19, Obama continued his outreach to the Muslim world, releasing a New Year's video message to the people and government of Iran. On June 4, 2009, Obama delivered a speech at ||Cairo_University|| in Egypt calling for "||A_New_Beginning_(speech)||" in relations between the Islamic world and the United States and promoting Middle East peace. On June 26, 2009, Obama condemned the Iranian government's actions towards protesters following ||2009_Iranian_presidential_election||. In 2011, Obama ordered a drone strike in Yemen which targeted and killed ||Anwar_al-Awlaki||. Awlaki was an American imam suspected of being an ||Al-Qaeda|| organizer and supporter. Awlaki became the first ||Citizenship_of_the_United_States|| to be targeted and killed by a ||Drone_strike|| without the rights of ||Due_process|| being afforded. The killing lead to significant controversy and may have increased Awlaki's influence. His ||Abdulrahman_al-Awlaki|| and ||Death_of_Nawar_al-Awlaki||, also Americans, were later killed in separate ||Raid_on_Yakla||, although they were not targeted specifically.  Obama meets with Italian Prime Minister ||Matteo_Renzi|| at the ||White_House||, October 2016.In March 2015, Obama declared that he had authorized U.S. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their ||Saudi_Arabian-led_intervention_in_Yemen||, establishing a "Joint Planning Cell" with Saudi Arabia. In 2016, the Obama administration proposed a series of ||Saudi_Arabia%E2%80%93United_States_relations|| worth $115 billion. Obama halted the sale of guided munition technology to ||Saudi_Arabia|| after Saudi warplanes ||2016_Sana%27a_funeral_airstrike|| in Yemen's capital Sanaa, killing more than 140 people. War in Iraq Main articles: ||Iraq_War|| and ||American-led_intervention_in_Iraq_(2014%E2%80%93present)|| On February 27, 2009, Obama announced that combat operations in Iraq would end within 18 months. The Obama administration scheduled the withdrawal of combat troops to be completed by August 2010, decreasing troop's levels from 142,000 while leaving a transitional force of about 50,000 in Iraq until the end of 2011. On August 19, 2010, the last U.S. combat brigade exited Iraq. Remaining troops transitioned from combat operations to ||Counter-terrorism|| and the training, equipping, and advising of Iraqi security forces. On August 31, 2010, Obama announced that the United States combat mission in Iraq was over. On October 21, 2011, President Obama announced that all U.S. troops would leave Iraq in time to be "home for the holidays."  Meeting with UK Prime Minister ||David_Cameron|| during the ||2010_G20_Toronto_summit|| In June 2014, following the ||Northern_Iraq_offensive_(June_2014)#Fall_of_Mosul_and_push_into_Kirkuk|| by ||Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant||, Obama sent 275 troops to provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. ISIS continued to gain ground and to commit ||Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant#Human_rights_abuse_and_war_crime_findings||. In August 2014, during the ||Sinjar_massacre||, Obama ordered a ||American-led_intervention_in_Iraq_(2014%E2%80%93present)#United_States_airstrikes||. By the end of 2014, 3,100 American ground troops were committed to the conflict and 16,000 sorties were flown over the battlefield, primarily by U.S. Air Force and Navy pilots. In early 2015, with the addition of the "Panther Brigade" of the ||82nd_Airborne_Division|| the number of U.S. ground troops in Iraq increased to 4,400, and by July American-led coalition air forces counted 44,000 sorties over the battlefield. War in Afghanistan Main article: ||War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%932021)||  Obama after a trilateral meeting with Afghan President ||Hamid_Karzai|| (left) and Pakistani President ||Asif_Ali_Zardari|| (right), White House Cabinet Room, May 2009 Early in his presidency, Obama moved to bolster U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan. He announced an increase in U.S. troop levels to 17,000 military personnel in February 2009 to "stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan", an area he said had not received the "strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires". He replaced the military commander in Afghanistan, General ||David_D._McKiernan||, with former ||Special_Forces_(United_States_Army)|| commander Lt. Gen. ||Stanley_A._McChrystal|| in May 2009, indicating that McChrystal's Special Forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war. On December 1, 2009, Obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to Afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date; this took place in July 2011. ||David_Petraeus|| replaced McChrystal in June 2010, after McChrystal's staff criticized White House personnel in a magazine article. In February 2013, Obama said the U.S. military would reduce the troop level in Afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 U.S. troops by February 2014. In October 2015, the White House announced a plan to keep U.S. Forces in Afghanistan indefinitely in light of the deteriorating security situation. Israel  Obama meeting with Israeli President ||Shimon_Peres|| in the ||Oval_Office||, May 2009 During the initial years of the Obama administration, the U.S. increased military cooperation with Israel, including increased military aid, re-establishment of the ||Joint_Political_Military_Group|| and the Defense Policy Advisory Group, and an increase in visits among high-level military officials of both countries. The Obama administration asked Congress to allocate money toward funding the ||Iron_Dome|| program in response to the waves of ||Palestinian_rocket_attacks_on_Israel||. In March 2010, Obama took a public stance against plans by the government of Israeli Prime Minister ||Benjamin_Netanyahu|| to continue building Jewish housing projects in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of ||East_Jerusalem||. In 2011, the United States vetoed a Security Council resolution condemning ||Israeli_settlement||, with the United States being the only nation to do so. Obama supports the ||Two-state_solution|| to the ||Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_conflict|| based on the 1967 borders with land swaps. In 2013, ||Jeffrey_Goldberg|| reported that, in Obama's view, "with each new settlement announcement, Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation." In 2014, Obama likened the ||Zionist_movement|| to the ||Civil_rights_movement|| in the United States. He said both movements seek to bring justice and equal rights to historically persecuted peoples, explaining: "To me, being pro-Israel and pro-Jewish is part and parcel with the values that I've been fighting for since I was politically conscious and started getting involved in politics." Obama expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the ||2014_Israel%E2%80%93Gaza_conflict||. In 2015, Obama was harshly criticized by Israel for advocating and signing the ||Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action||; Israeli Prime Minister ||Benjamin_Netanyahu||, who had advocated the U.S. congress to oppose it, said the deal was "dangerous" and "bad". On December 23, 2016, under the Obama Administration, the United States abstained from ||United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_2334||, which condemned ||Israeli_settlement|| building in the occupied ||Palestinian_territories|| as a violation of international law, effectively allowing it to pass. Netanyahu strongly criticized the Obama administration's actions, and the Israeli government withdrew its annual dues from the organization, which totaled $6 million, on January 6, 2017. On January 5, 2017, the ||United_States_House_of_Representatives|| voted 342–80 to condemn the UN Resolution. Libya Main article: ||2011_military_intervention_in_Libya||  President Obama meets with Russian President ||Vladimir_Putin|| to discuss Syria and ISIS, September 29, 2015. In February 2011, protests in Libya began against long-time dictator ||Muammar_Gaddafi|| as part of the ||Arab_Spring||. They soon turned violent. In March, as forces loyal to Gaddafi advanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, the ||Arab_League||, and a resolution passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate. In response to the unanimous passage of ||United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1973|| on March 17, Gaddafi—who had previously vowed to "show no mercy" to the rebels of Benghazi—announced an immediate cessation of military activities. The next day, on Obama's orders, the U.S. military took part in air strikes to destroy the Libyan government's air defense capabilities to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly-zone, including the use of ||Tomahawk_(missile)||, ||Northrop_Grumman_B-2_Spirit||, and fighter jets. Six days later, on March 25, by unanimous vote of all its 28 members, ||NATO|| took over leadership of the effort, dubbed ||Operation_Unified_Protector||. Some Representatives questioned whether Obama had the constitutional authority to order military action in addition to questioning its cost, structure and aftermath. Obama later expressed regret for playing a leading role in the destabilization of Libya, calling the certain situation there "a mess." He has stated that the lack of preparation surrounding the days following the government's overthrow was the "worst mistake" of his presidency. Syrian Civil War See also: ||Foreign_involvement_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War#United_States||, and ||American-led_intervention_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War|| On August 18, 2011, several months after the start of the ||Syrian_Civil_War||, Obama issued a written statement that said: "The time has come for ||Bashar_al-Assad|| to step aside." This stance was reaffirmed in November 2015. In 2012, Obama authorized multiple ||Timber_Sycamore|| and the Pentagon to train anti-Assad rebels. The Pentagon-run program was later found to have failed and was formally abandoned in October 2015. In the wake of a ||Ghouta_chemical_attack|| in Syria, ||U.S._Government_Assessment_of_the_Syrian_Government%27s_Use_of_Chemical_Weapons_on_August_21,_2013|| by the Obama administration on the Assad government, Obama chose not to enforce the "red line" he had pledged and, rather than authorize the promised military action against Assad, went along with the Russia-brokered deal that led to Assad ||Destruction_of_Syria%27s_chemical_weapons||; however attacks with ||Chlorine_gas|| continued. In 2014, Obama authorized an ||Military_intervention_against_ISIL||. Death of Osama bin Laden Main article: ||Killing_of_Osama_bin_Laden||  President Obama's address (9:28)Also available: ;  ||Wikisource||  Obama and members of the national security team receive an update on ||Operation_Neptune%27s_Spear|| in the ||White_House_Situation_Room||, May 1, 2011. See also: ||Situation_Room_(photograph)|| Starting with information received from Central Intelligence Agency operatives in July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence over the next several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of ||Osama_bin_Laden||. He was living in seclusion in ||Osama_bin_Laden%27s_compound_in_Abbottabad|| in ||Abbottabad||, Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles (56 km) from ||Islamabad||. CIA head ||Leon_Panetta|| reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011. Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a "surgical raid" to be conducted by ||United_States_Navy_SEALs||. The operation took place on May 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound. DNA testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin Laden's corpse, which was buried at sea several hours later. Within minutes of the President's announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City's ||World_Trade_Center_site|| and ||Times_Square||. ||Reactions_to_the_death_of_Osama_bin_Laden|| was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Iran nuclear talks Main article: ||Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action||  Obama talks with Benjamin Netanyahu, March 2013. On October 1, 2009, the Obama administration went ahead with a Bush administration program, increasing nuclear weapons production. The "Complex Modernization" initiative expanded two existing nuclear sites to produce new bomb parts. The administration built new plutonium pits at the Los Alamos lab in New Mexico and expanded enriched uranium processing at the Y-12 facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. In November 2013, the Obama administration opened ||Negotiations_leading_to_the_Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action|| with Iran to prevent it from acquiring ||Nuclear_weapon||, which included an ||Joint_Plan_of_Action||. Negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced on July 14, 2015. The deal titled the "Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action" saw sanctions removed in exchange for measures that would prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons. While Obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from Republican and conservative quarters, and from Israeli Prime Minister ||Benjamin_Netanyahu||. In addition, the transfer of $1.7 billion in cash to Iran shortly after the deal was announced was criticized by the republican party. The Obama administration said that the payment in cash was because of the "effectiveness of U.S. and international sanctions." In order to advance the deal, the Obama administration shielded ||Hezbollah|| from the ||Drug_Enforcement_Administration||'s ||Project_Cassandra|| investigation regarding drug smuggling and from the ||Central_Intelligence_Agency||. On a side note, the very same year, in December 2015, Obama started a $348 billion worth program to back the biggest U.S. buildup of nuclear arms since Ronald Reagan left the White House. Relations with Cuba Main article: ||Cuban_thaw||  President Obama meeting with Cuban President ||Ra%C3%BAl_Castro|| in Panama, April 2015 Since the spring of 2013, secret meetings were conducted between the United States and Cuba in the neutral locations of Canada and ||Vatican_City||. The Vatican first became involved in 2013 when ||Pope_Francis|| advised the U.S. and Cuba to ||Prisoner_exchange|| as a gesture of goodwill. On December 10, 2013, Cuban President ||Ra%C3%BAl_Castro||, in a significant public moment, greeted and shook hands with Obama at the ||Death_of_Nelson_Mandela|| in ||Johannesburg||. In December 2014, after the secret meetings, it was announced that Obama, with ||Pope_Francis|| as an intermediary, had negotiated a restoration of relations with Cuba, after nearly sixty years of détente. Popularly dubbed the ||Cuban_Thaw||, ||The_New_Republic|| deemed the Cuban Thaw to be "Obama's finest foreign policy achievement." On July 1, 2015, President Obama announced that formal diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States would resume, and embassies would be opened in Washington and ||Havana||. The countries' respective "interests sections" in one another's capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20 and August 13, 2015, respectively. Obama visited Havana, Cuba for two days in March 2016, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to arrive since ||Calvin_Coolidge|| in 1928. Africa Obama spoke in front of the ||African_Union|| in ||Addis_Ababa||, Ethiopia, on July 29, 2015, the first sitting U.S. president to do so. He gave a speech encouraging the world to increase economic ties via investments and trade with the continent, and lauded the progress made in ||Education_in_Africa||, infrastructure, and ||Economy_of_Africa||. He also criticized the lack of democracy and leaders who refuse to step aside, discrimination against minorities (||LGBT|| people, religious groups and ethnicities), and corruption. He suggested an intensified ||Democratization|| and free trade, to significantly improve the quality of life for Africans. During his July 2015 trip, Obama also was the first U.S. president ever to ||United_States_presidential_visits_to_Sub-Saharan_Africa|| Kenya, which is the homeland of his father. Hiroshima speech On May 27, 2016, Obama became the first sitting American president to visit ||Hiroshima||, Japan, 71 years after the ||Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki|| towards the end of ||World_War_II||. Accompanied by Japanese Prime Minister ||Shinz%C5%8D_Abe||, Obama paid tribute to the victims of the bombing at the ||Hiroshima_Peace_Memorial_Museum||. Although he was pressured to by atomic bomb survivor groups, he did not apologize for the decision to drop the bomb. Russia See also: ||Russia%E2%80%93United_States_relations#From_Obama's_first_term_to_election_of_Trump_(2009–16)||  Obama meets Russian President ||Vladimir_Putin|| in September 2015. In March 2010, an agreement was reached with the administration of Russian President ||Dmitry_Medvedev|| to replace the ||START_I|| with a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about a third. Obama and Medvedev signed the ||New_START|| treaty in April 2010, and the ||United_States_Senate|| ratified it in December 2010. In December 2011, Obama instructed agencies to consider ||LGBT_rights_by_country_or_territory|| when issuing financial aid to foreign countries. In August 2013, he criticized Russia's law that discriminates against gays, but he stopped short of advocating a boycott of the upcoming ||2014_Winter_Olympics|| in ||Sochi||, Russia. After ||Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation|| in 2014, ||Russian_military_intervention_in_Syria|| in Syria in 2015, and the ||2016_United_States_election_interference_by_Russia|| in the ||2016_United_States_presidential_election||, Obama's Russia policy was widely seen as a failure. ||George_Robertson,_Baron_Robertson_of_Port_Ellen||, a former UK defense secretary and NATO secretary-general, said Obama had "allowed Putin to jump back on the world stage and test the resolve of the West", adding that the legacy of this disaster would last. Cultural and political image Main article: ||Public_image_of_Barack_Obama|| See also: ||International_reactions_to_the_2008_United_States_presidential_election|| and ||International_reactions_to_the_2012_United_States_presidential_election|| Obama's family history, upbringing, and ||Ivy_League|| education differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in the ||Civil_rights_movement||. Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is "black enough", Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the ||National_Association_of_Black_Journalists|| that "we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong." Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: "I wouldn't be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation." Obama is frequently referred to as an exceptional orator. During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses. In his speeches as president, Obama did not make more overt references to race relations than his predecessors, but according to one study, he implemented stronger policy action on behalf of African-Americans than any president since the Nixon era.  Presidential approval ratings According to the ||Gallup_Organization||, Obama began his presidency with a 68 percent approval rating before gradually declining for the rest of the year, and eventually bottoming out at 41 percent in August 2010, a trend similar to ||Ronald_Reagan||'s and ||Bill_Clinton||'s first years in office. He experienced a small poll bounce shortly after the ||Death_of_Osama_bin_Laden|| on May 2, 2011. This bounce lasted until around June 2011, when his approval numbers dropped back to where they were previously. His approval ratings rebounded around the same time as his reelection in 2012, with polls showing an average job approval of 52 percent shortly after his second inauguration. Despite approval ratings dropping to 39 percent in late-2013 due to the ACA roll-out, they climbed to 50 percent in January 2015 according to Gallup. Polls showed strong support for Obama in other countries both before and during his presidency. In a February 2009 poll conducted in Western Europe and the U.S. by ||Harris_Insights_%26_Analytics|| for ||France_24|| and the ||International_Herald_Tribune||, Obama was rated as the most respected world leader, as well as the most powerful. In a similar poll conducted by Harris in May 2009, Obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn.  G8 leaders watching the ||2012_UEFA_Champions_League_Final|| Obama won ||Grammy_Award_for_Best_Spoken_Word_Album|| ||Grammy_Award|| for abridged ||Audiobook|| versions of ||Dreams_from_My_Father|| in February 2006 and for ||The_Audacity_of_Hope|| in February 2008. His ||Barack_Obama_presidential_primary_campaign,_2008#New_Hampshire|| after the New Hampshire primary was set to music by independent artists as the music video "||Yes_We_Can_(will.i.am_song)||", which was viewed ten million times on YouTube in its first month and received a ||Daytime_Emmy_Award||. In December 2008 and in 2012, ||Time_(magazine)|| magazine named Obama as its ||Time_Person_of_the_Year||. The 2008 awarding was for his historic candidacy and election, which Time described as "the steady march of seemingly impossible accomplishments." On May 25, 2011, Obama became the first president of the United States to address both houses of the ||Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom|| in ||Westminster_Hall||, London. This was only the fifth occurrence since the start of the 20th century of a head of state's being extended this invitation, following ||Charles_de_Gaulle|| in 1960, ||Nelson_Mandela|| in 1996, ||Elizabeth_II|| in 2002 and ||Pope_Benedict_XVI|| in 2010. On October 9, 2009, the ||Norwegian_Nobel_Committee|| announced that Obama had won the ||2009_Nobel_Peace_Prize|| "for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples." Obama accepted this award in ||Oslo||, Norway on December 10, 2009, with "deep gratitude and great humility." The award drew a mixture of praise and criticism from world leaders and media figures. Obama's peace prize was called a "stunning surprise" by ||The_New_York_Times||. Some ||Neoconservatism|| praised his speech for what they viewed as pro-American content. He became the fourth U.S. president to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and the third to become a Nobel laureate while in office. Obama's Nobel Prize was viewed skeptically in subsequent years, especially after the director of the Nobel Institute, ||Geir_Lundestad||, said that Obama's Peace Prize did not have the desired effect of encouraging the President. Post-presidency (2017–present)  Obama with his then-new successor ||Donald_Trump|| and his later successor ||Joe_Biden||, at the former's ||Inauguration_of_Donald_Trump|| on January 20, 2017 Obama's presidency ended on January 20, 2017, upon the ||Inauguration_of_Donald_Trump|| of his successor, ||Donald_Trump||. The family currently rents a house in ||Kalorama,_Washington,_D.C.|| On March 2, 2017, the ||John_F._Kennedy_Presidential_Library_and_Museum|| awarded the ||Profile_in_Courage_Award|| to Obama "for his enduring commitment to democratic ideals and elevating the standard of political courage." His first public appearance since leaving the office was a seminar at the ||University_of_Chicago|| on April 24, where he appealed for a new generation to participate in politics.  Obama playing golf with the President of Argentina ||Mauricio_Macri||, October 2017 When Trump announced his withdrawal of the United States from the ||Paris_Agreement|| on June 1, Obama released a statement disagreeing with the choice. After Senate Republicans revealed the ||Better_Care_Reconciliation_Act_of_2017||, their discussion draft of a health care bill to replace the Affordable Care Act, Obama released a Facebook post on June 22 calling the bill "a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America." On September 19, while delivering the keynote address at Goalkeepers, Obama admitted his frustration with Republicans backing "a bill that will raise costs, reduce coverage, and roll back protections for older Americans and people with pre-existing conditions." After Attorney General ||Jeff_Sessions|| announced the termination of the ||Deferred_Action_for_Childhood_Arrivals|| (DACA) program on September 5, Obama released a Facebook post criticizing the decision. Two days later, Obama partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush to work with ||One_America_Appeal|| to help the victims of ||Hurricane_Harvey|| and ||Hurricane_Irma|| in the ||Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States|| and ||Texas|| communities. Obama hosted the inaugural summit of the ||Obama_Foundation|| in Chicago from October 31 to November 1, 2017. He intends for the foundation to be the central focus of his post-presidency and part of his ambitions for his subsequent activities following his presidency to be more consequential than his time in office. In May 2018, Obama criticized President Trump's decision to withdraw from the nuclear deal with Iran under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action saying "the deal was working and it was in U.S. interests." Barack and Michelle Obama signed a deal on May 22, 2018, to produce docu-series, documentaries and features for ||Netflix|| under the Obamas' newly formed production company, ||Higher_Ground_Productions||. Higher Ground's first film, ||American_Factory||, won the ||Academy_Award_for_Best_Documentary_Feature|| in 2020.  Obama and his wife ||Michelle_Obama|| at the ||Inauguration_of_Joe_Biden|| He received a 63% approval rating in Gallup's 2018 job approval poll for the past 10 U.S. presidents. In 2019, Barack and Michelle Obama bought a home on ||Martha%27s_Vineyard|| from ||Wyc_Grousbeck||. On October 29, 2019, Obama criticized "||Woke||" and ||Cancel_culture|| at the Obama Foundation's annual summit. Obama was reluctant to make an endorsement in the ||2020_Democratic_presidential_primaries|| because he wanted to position himself to unify the party, no matter who the nominee was. On April 14, 2020, Obama endorsed his former vice president ||Joe_Biden||, the presumptive Democratic nominee, for president in the ||2020_United_States_presidential_election||, stating that he has "all the qualities we need in a president right now." In May 2020, Obama criticized President Trump for ||Trump_administration_communication_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic|| of the ||COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States||, calling his response to the crisis "an absolute chaotic disaster", and stating that the consequences of ||Presidency_of_Donald_Trump|| have been "our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before." Trump retaliated by accusing Obama of having committed "the biggest political crime in American history", although he refused to say what he was talking about, telling reporters: "You know what the crime is, the crime is very obvious to everybody." Obama wrote a presidential memoir, in a $65 million deal with ||Penguin_Random_House||. The book, ||A_Promised_Land||, was released on November 17, 2020. In February 2021, Obama and musician ||Bruce_Springsteen|| started a podcast called Renegades: Born in the USA where the two talk about "their backgrounds, music and their 'enduring love of America.'" In late 2021, Regina Hicks had signed a deal with ||Netflix||, in a venture with his and ||Michelle_Obama||'s ||Higher_Ground_Productions|| to develop comedy projects. On March 4, 2022, Obama won an Audio Publishers Association (APA) Award in the best narration by the author category for the narration of his memoir ||A_Promised_Land||. On April 5, 2022, Obama visited the White House for the first time since leaving office, in an event celebrating the 12th annual anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act. Legacy  Job growth during the presidency of Obama compared to other presidents, as measured as a cumulative percentage change from month after inauguration to end of his term Obama's most significant legacy is generally considered to be the ||Affordable_Care_Act|| (ACA), provisions of which went into effect from 2010 to 2020. Many attempts by Senate Republicans to repeal the ACA, including a "skinny repeal", have thus far failed, however in 2017 the penalty for violating the individual mandate was repealed effective 2019. Together with the ||Health_Care_and_Education_Reconciliation_Act|| amendment, it represents the ||Health_care_in_the_United_States||'s most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of ||Medicare_(United_States)|| and ||Medicaid|| in 1965. Many commentators credit Obama with averting a threatened ||Depression_(economics)|| and pulling the economy back from the ||Great_Recession||. According to the ||U.S._Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics||, the ||Obama_administration|| created 11.3 million jobs from the month after ||First_inauguration_of_Barack_Obama|| to the end of his term. In 2010, Obama signed into effect the ||Dodd%E2%80%93Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act||. Passed as a response to the ||Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308||, it brought the most significant changes to ||Financial_regulation|| in the United States since the regulatory reform that followed the ||Great_Depression|| under Democratic President ||Franklin_D._Roosevelt||. In 2009, Obama signed into law the ||National_Defense_Authorization_Act_for_Fiscal_Year_2010||, which contained in it the ||Matthew_Shepard_and_James_Byrd_Jr._Hate_Crimes_Prevention_Act||, the first addition to existing federal hate crime law in the United States since Democratic President ||Bill_Clinton|| signed into law the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act expanded ||Hate_crime_laws_in_the_United_States|| to apply to crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaged in a federally protected activity. As president, Obama advanced LGBT rights. In 2010, he signed the ||Don%27t_Ask,_Don%27t_Tell_Repeal_Act_of_2010||, which brought an end to "||Don%27t_ask,_don%27t_tell||" policy in the U.S. armed forces that banned open service from ||Lesbian,_gay_and_bisexual|| people; the law went into effect the following year. In 2016, his administration brought an end to the ban on ||Transgender|| people serving openly in the U.S. armed forces. A ||Gallup_poll||, taken in the final days of Obama's term, showed that 68 percent of Americans believed the U.S. had made progress on LGBT rights during Obama's eight years in office. Obama substantially escalated the use of ||Drone_strikes|| against suspected militants and terrorists associated with ||Al-Qaeda|| and the ||Taliban||. In 2016, the last year of his presidency, the U.S. dropped 26,171 bombs on seven different countries. Obama left about 8,400 U.S. troops in ||Afghanistan||, 5,262 in Iraq, 503 in Syria, 133 in Pakistan, 106 in Somalia, seven in Yemen, and two in Libya at the end of his presidency. According to ||Pew_Research_Center|| and ||United_States_Bureau_of_Justice_Statistics||, from December 31, 2009, to December 31, 2015, inmates sentenced in U.S. federal custody declined by five percent. This is the largest decline in sentenced inmates in U.S. federal custody since Democratic President ||Jimmy_Carter||. By contrast, the federal prison population increased significantly under presidents ||Ronald_Reagan||, ||George_H._W._Bush||, ||Bill_Clinton||, and ||George_W._Bush||. According to ||Julian_E._Zelizer||'s The Presidency of Barack Obama, under Obama's presidency, the "Democrats lost more than one thousand seats in state legislatures, governors' mansions, and Congress during his time in office." adding that Obama "turned out to be a very effective policymaker but not a tremendously successful party builder." During Obama's presidency, a record 3.2 million people ||Deportation_and_removal_from_the_United_States||. His record deportations earned Obama the nickname "Deporter in Chief". In February 2020, Biden called the deportation of hundreds of thousands of people without criminal records under the Obama administration a "big mistake". Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60 percent approval rating. A 2018 survey of historians by the ||American_Political_Science_Association|| ranked Obama the ||Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States||. Obama gained 10 spots from the same survey in 2015 from the ||Brookings_Institution|| that ranked him the 18th-greatest American president.
